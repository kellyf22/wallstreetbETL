Gripe Thread","Trash",0.87,70,0,1,177,0,"Instant deposits and instant settlement is only available thanks to margin. Don't believe me? Move to a cash account.

Robinhood's stance has always been ""[\[c\]ryptocurrencies are non-marginable and can’t count as collateral, so you’ll need to have enough cash in your account to place the order](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/why-cant-i-place-a-buy-order-on-a-cryptocurrency)"" ...and if Robinhood is still waiting for the stock or options trade to settle (T+2 for equities or T+1 for contracts), the money is not in your account. If they're still waiting for [an] ACH transfer, the money is not in your account yet. Your '[buying power](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/settlement-and-buying-power/)' in both cases is margin.

Now, I don't know why Robinhood hasn't stated it that clearly but they sure af need to because there's a lot of stupid people posting that money from selling crypto is now subject to settlement periods which wouldn't make any sense (settlement periods are defined by FINRA and enforced by the SEC and these regulators have fuck all to do with cryptocurrency). If you think you have buying power issues somehow related to this, welcome to Robinhood. The guy there who can do math doesn't work weekends.

By the way, I'm sure the WilmerHale folks they've brought on over the last six months are going to make a lot of annoying changes like this one and getting rid of 'high risk' vehicles the other week before Robinhood goes public. Expect it.","self","https://redd.it/ktwy0c"

If selected, you will be put in contact with Robinhood's Social & Community team on our behalf. You will be expected to join monthly conference calls with Robinhood, make educated decisions on your own, be able to sufficiently implement plans you devise, and be willing to work with the moderation teams here on Reddit and on Discord as required (i.e., be willing and able to ask for help!).

Further details will be provided to anyone who makes the short list of candidates.

## Who Should Apply

If you...

* ...are more than marginally interested in the financial industry
* ...can be depended on in general
* ...have no conflicts that may complicate serving in the best interest of the **community** of /r/Robinhood
* ...are excited by the prospect of helping a multi-billion dollar corporation for free
* ...can clearly communicate ideas by phone and in text
* ...are willing to stay in regular contact with Robinhood by phone
* ...are willing to stay in contact with the various moderation teams via [Discord](https://discord.gg/robinhood)
* ...are old enough to have an account and that account is in good standing with Robinhood
* ...are willing to work with another person if two are picked for this (or if you have a buddy who'll also apply, that's a bonus)

...you might be who we're looking for.

## How to Apply

[Send modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Robinhood). Do not send PMs to moderators and do not contact Robinhood directly. Only applications sent via modmail will be considered!

### What to Include in Your Application

Answer the following:

1. Who are you on Discord? Provide your username and differentiator (e.g., CardinalNumber#0001)
 
2. Are you in a position to set aside an hour or so in the middle of the day to handle a scheduled AMA, a conference call with Robinhood, or similar tasks?
 
3. Have you ever been banned from any subreddits? If so, list them (reason for the ban is not required and will not be considered).
 
4. In your own words, briefly answer these questions after reading them carefully:

 1. What is day trade buying power, when does it apply, and how is it calculated?
 2. How long are the settlement periods for stocks, options, and Bitcoin?
 3. Where were you around 1p Eastern on January 6th, 2021?

5. If selected, what topics of conversation would you most be interested in for future AMAs?
 
6. Have you ever been involved in an AMA in any way (not specifically as an organizer; just asking quality questions in an AMA will suffice)? The AMA may be anywhere across Reddit on any topic. Links are welcome.

7. What specifically makes you a great candidate for this task? (Previous experience, etc.)","self","https://redd.it/l43bsa"

[Wes Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore) does not work for Robinhood Financial (this sub's mods don't either, btw).

People who apparently never used Google before decide to try it out when they're angry and mistake Robinhood Financial with [the Robin Hood Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_Foundation)... a non-profit that has existed in the NYC area since the 1980s and continues to do good work for those less fortunate. **Wes Moore is the CEO of the charity** not the brokerage. The same thing happens often enough that his name was temporarily filtered here years ago but the most recent (I haven't really sifted through this sub today) [threat posted here was just days ago](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673202612769783818/801147115433754643/Screenshot_20210119-125135.jpg). I forget what was going on on the 19th when that was posted but someone was upset beyond rational thought. That person was banned and the comment removed but I'm putting this in full public view today because not long after I joked about it likely happening this afternoon, [someone full on did it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamwesmoore/status/1354853810729086983?s=19).

Once again, **Wes Moore has no affiliation with Robinhood Financial.** I need everyone to be smart for me. I know you're upset but threats against anyone's life will not be tolerated.","self","https://redd.it/l770jp"

I'm not 100% sure where this post is going so I can't promise I'll answer any of those questions but my goal here is still coherent conversation so maybe someone else might have those answers in the comments. Idk.

## What is Citadel and what do they do?

[A hedge fund wrapped up with an advisory service, an execution venue, a market maker, an IPO partner, a ~~sandwich shop~~, etc.](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/). Such megacorps pay firms fractions of a cent to pass each order through them for execution. The more orders the brokerage passes along, the more they're paid. Money is involved because the more orders that pass through a particular execution venue first, the faster they can make decisions about the direction of the market on both the micro and macro scale. This is the current nature of the market. Order data for 'new' and 'small' traders using self-directed firms has been especially valuable the last 20 years because you do things institutions cannot. You can open a new position based on a tweet while the major advisory services need to whip out the scales and weigh the cost of moving assets for countless customers at once and that's even further complicated if they're designated fiduciaries because, in their book, reacting quickly implies that there's unknown risks involved. For example, they did the numbers on a particular company six months ago and decided it wouldn't be profitable in another six months. Even in 2021, they just can't move as fast as you but knowing what you're doing is a step closer to them being able to respond sooner with smaller changes rather than react with major changes when shit hits the fan. (BTW, the fatal flaw on $GME is that they tried to play the old 'cull the weak' game that worked for them for decades and absolutely chose to ignore the direction the market was moving until it was too late. If they'd used the order flow and other data they're paying so much cash to access and were as bright as they imagine they are, it would have been rough but even hardcore shorts could have lived through this week. Retail investors can pat themselves on the back for exploiting it but Melvin Capital got fucked by hubris and lack of awareness.)

Not to get all RZA between songs on it but that's why the title of this sub has been '[Welcome to the machine!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Machine)' for a long time now. The major players know you dream of making it big, buying a car, having a steak, and all the other things Roger wrote about, just by doing something you enjoy (playing guitar but it could be your art, you talents in math or science, taps in a mobile game, or in this instance investing) and they'll welcome you in with open arms, convince you that they'll be a guide and there to help, knowing they'll get a cut just by letting you do what you do and finding a way to package it. People over simplify it with ""if the service is free, you are the product"" because they don't notice that the machine will also make you pay if it can. Money for order flow has made it easier for others to provide the space for you to do what you do without noticing they're cashing in even if you don't but don't forget that the machine can be other investors. The machine can be the large firms. The machine can be investment advice columnists. Hedge funds and brokerages aren't the only 'machine operators' in the financial industry.

## Which firms use Citadel and which ones don't?

They all use Citadel.

I'm not joking, I've kept up to date on execution venues (people probably thought I was just lecturing them about understanding order flow here but I dislike Virtu as a venue and Apex as a clearing firm which I've talked about here for years) and the concentration of orders being fed to the short list of venues has not changed in a positive way because that's where the money is. The idea for this post came to me this morning because no news article, no TV interview, and not a single hot take on Twitter I've read so far has managed to mention just how embedded Citadel individually is in the modern market. I had AOC's live stream on in the background last night and even the guests seemed to imply that Citadel is a little firm propping up Robinhood and that nobody could have seen this blowing up one day. These relationships (even down to how much money is paid) are public by law. Every quarter, both sides are required to release data on order flow in 605 (raw), and 606/607 reports.

Here's a quick rundown of places I could come up with off the top of my head that use Citadel as their primary or secondary execution venue and what percentage of orders for S&P 500 listed securities they recently sent through Citadel:

Firm | Market orders % | Marketable\* limit orders %

\* Marketable limit orders are those that immediately have a chance of executing against the current spread

^# Firsttrade is predominantly a dark pool only sending orders away when they require liquidity

^$ Alpaca is an API-first firm which I like and talk about on Discord sometimes because I wish RH would open their API but they're still backed by Apex which I dissuade everyone from getting involved with because Penson Financial Services.

^% IEX is a closed loop exchange that internally clears orders among customers (great source for free order data to test algos)

^@ Apex is the clearing agent for many smaller firms including Public.com, Betterment, Acorns, M1, Rize, Stockpile, Stash,  

Now, when you look at that list, remember three things:

 - that 99.9% of the remaining orders are going to [Wolverine](https://www.tradewex.com/), [Virtu](https://www.virtu.com/), [2 Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), and other hedge fund adjacent venues for execution

 - brokerages were doing the same back when they were also charging commissions. I don't feel firms being paid for order flow is inherently wrong but whatever agreement Citadel has in place to force firms to act in Citadel's best interest over customers and even over the brokerage's own best interest is difficult to wrap my mind around right now. Which brings me to my next point...

 - Citadel's most loyal sources for order flow (Robinhood, TDA, Webull, and IB) all fell in line and limited trading at least part of the day. The agreements between these companies and Citadel are obviously not public but I'm sure Citadel has them bent over a contractual barrel that left them with no choice but to comply. As a customer of half of those firms, I say they should have done whatever they could to explain the **actual** situation to the public (spoilers: it wasn't risk on the retail side), taken whatever penalties Citadel could impose for ignoring them (all the way up to breach of contract, etc), and fight *that* out in court rather than act in ways that seems to have only punished and confused customers. Corporate level decision making is so fucking stupid.

## Where to go?

[Fino](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fuck_if_I_know).

If IEX was larger, that would be a decent alternative for equities but they don't have a silly app that looks good in screenshots but tells you nothing useful. I can't think of a self-directed firm that can currently exist without Citadel and the rest. If you do, post about it, I guess.

## More things I for sure do not know...

...but hope someone wants to talk about.

 - I don't know shit about the legality of anything that has gone on this week with Robinhood and no, I will not be a part of any lawsuit because I was not effected by what happened because I don't have any options or equity holdings in Robinhood and cannot claim damages. Stop asking me.

 - I'm not even sure if splitting corporations up anti-trust style would work for this. For sure, it was Citadel's vested interest that cascaded down to firms and then users but I don't know of any cases that forced divestiture on that scale. Hedge funds with cases in a friendly district could make a valid claim that they cannot function without access to both order data and current assets. It'll be interesting to see if anything changes over the next few years and how.

## Disclosure

Doxxing myself more and more but I worked for a market analytics/quantitative research firm in the city that was eventually gobbled up by Virtu. I'd moved abroad months earlier anyway but we loved that job and they only wanted the algos we'd designed so fuck Virtu.

My current day job makes trading public companies complex (which is why I only talk about algotrading ETH on Discord). Most of my self-directed play money is still with TDA (haven't made a trade there or on RH in almost three years) but the majority of my family's assets, my retirement, my kid's inheritances and college funds, and on and on have been handled by GS for nearly two decades and likely will continue to be even after I return to the private sector. Now, what would be sweet is if Goldman Sachs would extend their investment arm ([which sends orders directly to exchanges](https://www.goldmansachs.com/compliance/Rule606/GSCO_606_Q3_2020.20201019135909.pdf)) to the general public like they have with their Marcus savings accounts. If they could devise a way to legally pass a good percentage of all (would be dependent on volume of the security, etc.) orders directly to the floor as a bundle, they'd break even at best on it but that would actually 'democratize the market.'","self","https://redd.it/l80dza"

Well, this week, I was given such top secret information but considering what has taken place recently, I just cannot in good conscience keep this quiet.~~ Folks, none of us will not be allowed to buy or sell equities or options contracts this upcoming Monday, the 15th of February. ~~It's all going to be shut down. It's over. They even got the banks to agree to close for the day to make sure you can't move your money. It's... I'm sorry.~~

~~I mean doubleyewteeaitch, Robinhood?!?~~

One month of Reddit Gold to... whoever had the best week? By percentage gains? That'll work. You have until... Well, I guess the bell on Tuesday morning to post screenshots and must also include a blurb about holdings.

We know. In an attempt to keep things running smoothly, this thread will be stuck to the top of the sub this month and (depending on how many tax questions we get in April) will return before Tax Day.

**Post your tax questions here rather than cluttering up the sub.**

Frequently asked questions will be added to this post so review it before asking. And please remember that unqualified advice and kind suggestions is the best anyone should expect for free. Pay a professional who'll be responsible for your taxes being filed on time and correctly.

I'm adding a few simple questions to get the ball rolling:

  0. Q. What are taxes? What is going on? I'm scared!

      A. 

  1. Q: I have a complex tax question, where should I post?

      A: /r/tax should be your first stop. They aren't required to give free tax advice either but at least it's not Newbie HQ. Their sidebar also contains links to all the ol' standards (/r/accounting, /r/personalfinance, /r/legaladvice).

  2. Q: When will Robinhood provide tax documents?!?
 
      A: According to [Robinhood's support site](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/common-tax-questions/), 1099 series data will be available in mid-February. Do not ask us for exact dates; no one here knows what Robinhood is up to. Please review the support pages and become familiar with the process of accessing the documents, finding your account number, etc. so you're ready when they're ready.

  3. Q: The tax info Robinhood gave me is wrong! What do I do now?

      A: According to [Robinhood's support site](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/tax-form-corrections/), you should contact them as soon as possible. Typos, incorrect data, weirdness?
 Just [contact support](https://robinhood.com/contact) if things don't add up.

  4. Q: Can I file my federal taxes for free?
  
      A: If you aren't a part of the 1%, odds are you can! For options, see the IRS's page: https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/. I suggest [Free File delivered by TurboTax](https://freefile.intuit.com/) (formerly 'Freedom Edition') or [H&R Block Free File](https://www.hrblock.com/online-tax-filing/free-online-tax-filing/)... both of which can file state returns for free and support Schedule D/1099 series forms.

      If you'd like to take advantage of Robinhood's deal on TurboTax Premier, you will receive a $15 discount! Once again, see their [support page](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000130883-TurboTax) for more info.

  5. Q: What about state?
 
      A: There's a good chance your state has a program set up that mirrors the federal system. Google ""[your state here] free tax filing"" and stick to your state's .gov or otherwise official pages (for example, [New York](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/efile/), [South Carolina](https://dor.sc.gov/services/free-file), [Maryland](http://taxes.marylandtaxes.com/Resource_Library/Filing_Methods/)).

  6. Q: Anyone else waiting for their tax data?

      A: Yes. Stop creating threads about it. Stop commenting the same thing in unrelated threads. Check your documents page: https://robinhood.com/account/documents Read [the support page for tax documents](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/downloading-your-tax-documents/). Everyone knows I only trade ETH so I'm only expecting 1099-B data from Robinhood Crypto and 2020 data is already there in both PDF and CSV.","self","https://redd.it/lkup5p"

**Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA)**, Chairwoman of the House Committee on Financial Services, made the following statement regarding recent market instability:

>Hedge funds have a long history of predatory conduct and that conduct is entirely indefensible. Private funds preying on the pension funds of hard working Americans must be stopped. Private funds engaging in predatory short selling to the detriment of other investors must be stopped. Private funds engaging in vulture strategies that hurt workers must be stopped.  
>  
>Addressing that predatory and manipulative conduct is the responsibility of lawmakers and securities regulators who are charged with protecting investors and ensuring that our capital markets are fair, orderly, and efficient. As a first step in reining in these abusive practices, I will convene a hearing to examine the recent activity around GameStop (GME) stock and other impacted stocks with a focus on short selling, online trading platforms, gamification and their systemic impact on our capital markets and retail investors.  
>  
>We must deal with the hedge funds whose unethical conduct directly led to the recent market volatility and we must examine the market in general and how it has been manipulated by hedge funds and their financial partners to benefit themselves while others pay the price.

On RH mobile it isn't as clear in saying buy/sell to close.

1. If I bought 100 shares at $7 and sold a call for $3.2 at $10 strike and now the price of the stock went up, the option shows to have gone up in price too but *my* option shows to have lost value and total returns show in minus/red. Is that because if I wanted to buy to close it, I would have to buy it at the new *option* price and lose money?
2. But then if I try to buy it and use a stop price, if I put my original bid price of $3.2 it says that it is lower than the current price and would trigger immediately. But wouldn't that allow me to not lose money? as i would buy it at the cost I sold it for? and/or am trying I using stop price wrong?
3. Now if I bought a call at a strike lower than the current price and the stock went down the option also shows to have lost value. So if I want to sell to close, I would have to sell for the now lower option price and lose money? 
4. Here also, if I try to sell the call and put a stop price higher than the current bid (the price i bought for) it shows the same warning. 

Thanks for the help.","self","https://redd.it/lqolvk"

For example, let’s say I have stock A with maintenance requirement of 25% and I invested $1000. I also have stock B with maintenance requirement of 35% and I also invested $1000.

So I have $2000 total invested. Does this mean I will take 35% of $2000 and my portfolio cannot go below that or is it just 35% of the $1000 investment in that specific stock B? Meaning my account has to stay above $350? Or my account has to stay above $700? The wording of this shit is so confusing...

The initial requirement doesn’t make sense either. What do they mean by 50% in cash? In order to use margin in the first place, you have to use all the cash so how do you keep 50% of your cash if you have to use all of it to even use margin?","self","https://redd.it/lqoot7"

I do use a lot of google, and find the news section very helpful. 

[Investopedia.com](https://Investopedia.com)   


To Check if the company has paid divs

[https://www.dividendinvestor.com/dividend-history-detail/t/](https://www.dividendinvestor.com/dividend-history-detail/t/)

RSI, 200DMA, 20DMA, I use it for charting/trading a bit

[https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui)

The most useful one! Gives me gems all the time. Learn formulas you like and plug them in! Google the terms ([investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com/)) and see what makes sense

[https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&ft=4)

Good for all the financials (assets/liabilities, so on)

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CNK/cinemark-holdings-inc/total-assets](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CNK/cinemark-holdings-inc/total-assets)

Institutional Ownership, I use this a lot (I personally like it low for growth stocks, high for divs)

[https://fintel.io/so/us/ocgn](https://fintel.io/so/us/ocgn)

FDA calendar, biotech plays. I check it a couple months out  
[https://www.rttnews.com/CorpInfo/FDACalendar.aspx?PageNum=4](https://www.rttnews.com/CorpInfo/FDACalendar.aspx?PageNum=4)

 For the investments I'm deleting, I do not want them to happen on 4/1, I'm purposely deleting them now so that they do not go through on 4/1.





Is there another step I need to take in addition to deleting the investment to make sure that those don't go through on 4/1? Or am I all set?

So Gamestop went up pretty high, then plummeted. I sold my shares right away, & made a total of $5 profit.  The next day, I invested in Koss, I think 2 or 3 shares.  Don't remember how much of a profit I made, if at all, but didn't really take a loss.  I just thought it was too risky bc it was fluctuating so much.  There were a couple of others that I decided to sell, but then I got a notification about being a pattern day trader, and my account would be flagged.  I waited a week, & decided to sell a high volatility stock.  It was up & down so much that when it got to a profit, maybe a few bucks, I decided to sell.  I got the same notification.  There are some, like go pro, that I want to leave long term, but if I think it's not worth it, I just want to sell what I have & invest somewhere else. The majority of these stocks are anywhere from about a $1 to $13, so they aren't getting just a whole lot from money from me anyway.

My understanding is that the 100 shares of the stock are released and now free to be used to open another CC but when I went to open another CC I received the pop up alert stating I can't because of margin requirements. FYI, I do not use margin (not a Gold account). I believe my account is Instant.

I'm wondering if this is a settlement issue and I have to wait until tomorrow to open new CC position (???). Doesn't seem to make sense to me since I have the 100 shares and they aren't tied to any other contract, but maybe I'm missing something. Any information is appreciated.","self","https://redd.it/m79dbi"
