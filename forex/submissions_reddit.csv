The strategy is very simple, from ICT (many people hate him but I think it suites my personality), the strategy is:  
1) Mark the opening price at midnight NY Time.  
2) Wait for the previous day's high/low to get violated.  
3) I'll wait until 8:30am NY Time to be able to execute positions.  
4) At 8:30AM, if the daily high is violated, I'll mark a fib from the lowest swing low after the midnight opening price and extend it out. When 8:30 comes, it needs to drop down into the 62-79% retracement level, and provide me with a bounce that breaks a short term swing high, if the daily low is violated, then I'll do the same but the fib would be with the highest high after midnight.  
5) When the 5 min swing high/low gets violated, I'll draw my fib on that range and execute on the 62% with my stop below the fib base.  
6) If 11AM NY Time comes, and I don't get an entry I walk away.  


These are the two positions I took today, GBPUSD was a disappointment as I went against the plan and tried to short it and it costed me a loss, second loss from AUDUSD was a disappointment as well since the 11AM Cutoff time passed and I still entered, but next week shall be better.  


If there is anyone that would like to hold me accountable as well, you can private message me each day to ensure I do a post as it's pretty much guaranteed that I'll trade everyday.

I am still not a consistently profitable trader (mainly for emotional issues, I even got a guy funded by giving them one of the strategies I backtested lol), and if that bothers you feel free to ignore my advices.

I would like to propose to this community to participate in a collective backtesting session based on the same strategy. I would essentially provide you with a strategy, a spreadsheet template to gather your trades, and give you a deadline to complete one year worth of testing - I will, of course, participate as well. I will then post a new thread where we can analyze the results together and come to a conclusion about the strategy we have tested: this can either be that the strategy does not work and should be scrapped; that the strategy works and should be forward tested; that the strategy has potential and should be optimized.

I wanted to do this for a while, but there were some problems with the idea: mainly the fact that not everyone has access to a backtesting software, and I didn't want to force people to pay for TradingView's subscription. I am doing this thread now because I believe I have found a strategy that involves zero discretion, meaning that you can technically test it without hiding future price action. It is always ideal to do so, of course, but if the method has no margin of interpretation, future price action won't affect your decision unless you're willingly breaking the rules.

The strategy I have chosen is the **Inside Bar Momentum Strategy**, designed by **Robopip**, one of the bloggers over on Babypips. It is an incredibly simple, price action based technical strategy that the author has been forward testing for the last two years. He has posted an article per week in which he shows all the valid trades and the results, as well as quarterly updates to give the overall returns of the strategy. You can find the rules of the system [here](https://www.babypips.com/trading/new-forex-system-inside-bar-momentum-strategy), an example of weekly update [here](https://www.babypips.com/trading/forex-inside-bar-20201218) and the latest quarterly report [here](https://www.babypips.com/trading/q4-2020-review-inside-bar-momentum-strategy). 

The strategy appears to be very profitable. However, there is a catch: **I don't believe him**. I think he is full of it, and that he is not telling the full story. The returns he shows are insanely high for a strategy that you could technically turn into an EA to print free money every month. Why have I chosen to backtest a strategy that will most likely dissapoint us, then? It's because one of the main advantages of backtesting is that **backtesting is painful**, more so than live trading in my personal opinion. You're forced to experience months worth of losses and drawdowns in the span of a few hours, and seeing a strategy you so desperately want to be good fail is incredibly frustrating and painful.

And this is the best source of growth. The pain backtesting gave me made me a more grounded trader, it helped me achieve more realistic expectations from my edges, and it massively improved my discipline. I believe testing a failed strategy will make us better at this. Or, perhaps I am wrong, and this strategy has an edge. Meaning that, on top of the discipline you gain from backtesting, you also will come out of it a profitable trader. If the strategy turns out to be a dud, you will still walk away with more experience. 

I think this would be a fun little project, and the aim of this thread is to test the community interest in doing this. Simply let me know your thoughts, and if we can manage to get a handful of people interested in taking part in this I'll make another thread in a few days where I outline the strategy, give you the spreadsheet and the deadline.","self","https://redd.it/kod1xl"

Think about that for a second. The people who give advice on how to trade profitably and shoot down other people or claim other peoples way of trading is down right wrong, aren’t profitable. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with not being profitable. We were all there at one time. Also it’s an admirable thing to see people admitting they’re not profitable, it’s a big hit on the pride of someone. My problem is when they’re so adamant on what they know to be true when in fact behind closed doors the very same advice isn’t being used by the person who gave it. 

It’s like taking advice from someone who is in uni as suppose to someone who has actually graduated. 

Also before people think I’m telling everyone to not give advice if they aren’t profitable, that’s not what I’m saying. What I’m saying is don’t be so adamant and aggressive in your opinions to shoot down other people who look and approach trading differently to you when you’re still in the learning stage of trading yourself.

In actuality, no amount of news or fundamentals will explain anything. Things are not as correlated as they seem, either. For instance the US stock market has hit ATH yet at the very same time the dollar has been weakening. Those who watch the DXY’s price action as opposed to watching news would see this

News is also there to distract, and if anything you should wait after news events like NFP/ FOMC. 

Either way, there will never be a true explanation for anything. If you backtest certain news events or rumors, the price always follows the trend anyway.

Lets say price is trending downward. News may spike the pair, especially if it stalled and showed slight upside momentum at a support (engulfings, moving averages, etc). It will more than likely spike, but then it continues down anyway. Its more profitable to wait after and get on that lower high point riding the trend

im in no way rich or whatever but the less you pay attention to the news, or even try to wonder WHY a price did this or that, you’ll never really get the correct answer. Forex and world markets dont give a shit about the vaccine either lol. people dont click buy when they hear a special report at 9am about vaccines, they were there buying low at 6:30am/7am when everyone was asleep. 

The ONLY thing that does show the future of a currency is the GDP and unemployment rate. Because if the unemployment rate is too high, Fed wont raise rates, meaning a weak dollar. Its just that simple. we have access to the same data they do. Facts over sensationalist news

This is the trade I have been looking at, EUR/USD on the 4hr, to me looks like a pretty basic short to get the feet wet, we have a trendline that has flipped support and resistance a couple times over the last 4-5 months that is about to be tested, MACD and RSI both in bearish divergence and trending down.

I haven't set up my specific buy-in price or the % of profits I would take at the indicated lines there in the green, but I was going to set up a stop-loss of 1% and try and ride the pair to the bottom support I have indicated with the horizontal trendline.

I would like critiques of my proposed trade and of my basic technical analysis since I do not have the eyes of a forex trader yet!

Looking For Some Friendly Advice On The Start Up :)","Brokers",0.86,5,0,0,5,0,"Hi, I'm a new trader and I am just looking for advice on how to get up and going, but going in the right direction from the get go.  

I'm from the UK

Been studying finance and the markets for about 6 months, I feel as that I'm progressing in the right manner.

I Invest in ETF's and Bonds via Vanguard 

I use trading view for my market research and personal chart training and testing. I like the layout ( I've tried mt4 and NT4 but nah).

I want to Invest in **Stocks** (maybe in a few months when I feel comfortable) ((my stock trading account will be very small to begin with))

Eventually, I want to speculate using **Forex** markets when I've completed my testing and I feel comfortable (1+ year from now maybe)

I understand there are many things to look at when choosing a broker, but something that is ALWAYS high on my list is ease of access and being user friendly. So following this, would you guys recommend attaching a brokerage account to Trading view. After all, that sounds pretty easy to me! But then I have the problem of, I'm not sure if it is best price wise, like do they offer bad deals, Is that why I don't see the big dogs like TD and CS on TV... 

Some I've looked into are Oanda, AMP, Saxo, TradeStation and IB. Does anyone have personal experiences with linking their TV account with these, Or have any recommendations of what I should look into before making a decision. are certain brokers better at focusing on a single market? I hear Oanda focuses on FX, and AMP right? 

Hope someone can shed some insight, as I said I've been studying maybe 6 months, and want to start dipping my toes in some long term stocks. I will not be scalping or day trading, yet XD.","self","https://redd.it/kopnww"

Global central bank intervention caused a “wall of money” to flow from one asset to another, resulting in a year when “everything went up”.

Market participants can notice a dangerous trend over the past 2 months. **The riskier an asset is and the less intrinsic value it has, the better the asset has performed since November.** Moreover, this “wall of money” is not infinite, and is flowing into assets with smaller market caps.

To be honest it makes me sick. How as a community should we combat this? I see it in the FX and the crypto communities. Can we name and shame? (Is that against Reddit policy? Even if I have screenshots?) can we call them out? Have a weekly scammer banning thread? Bait with them for hours to waste their time?

I come from Engineering background and I started my career as a developer, right now I work as a project manager.

now let's start with what I have learnt so far and I am here sharing my own experience maybe I am right or maybe I am wrong, you are welcome to comment.

1. Indicators don't work, I have tested hundreds of indicators using soft4fx and definitely in my opinion a strategy based only on indicator won't work.
2. Limit or Stop orders are better than market orders as they reduce the instant excitement or fear placing a market order.
3. Price actions are really judgmental as well as patterns, I can see a horse while you see a rocket from the same pattern.
4. This one is important back testing is not reliable on Mt4, I have created many robots and testing them live vs back testing always gave different results for the same period.
5. Time of the day is really important to place trades.
6. Sticking to a currency pair for long period is better than jumping from one pair to another.

You may wonder why I am giving up, I have invested so much time but without real progress. I haven't lost a big amount of money because I was strict on how much to risk with, but I haven't seen any benefit from moving on to spend more time in the market. I don't say you can't make money in Forex but for someone who is results oriented I can admit maybe my personality doesn't fit with how the trading job works.

I am always open to conversation or chat as long as it is a respectful one.

Have a great 2021 and good luck to find what I haven't found.","self","https://redd.it/kpq435"

I took trading seriously in nov 20 and it actually got to the point where I started making a decent amount from it. I know it hasn’t been a while... but still.  Then my personal life started falling apart, and I started hating myself, thinking I’m some kind of failure. I started having these thoughts about sabotaging my trading and even having dreams about it. I increased my lot size and knew it was going to blow up my account. Things in my life began to become worse and today my account finally blew up. It was almost like I waited for it to happen. I was slightly shocked but not really. Sorry, I just really needed to rant.

But my real question here is how I prevent this in the future?

It might be a little offtopic as I a m not interested in day trading but more about longer term trends.

I know it's impossible to predict the future, but are there any trends or macro factors that might impact USDGBP exchange rate in 2021?

GBP has been trending down over the past few years due to brexit, which is now done so I assume most of it is already priced in. Is it?

Both US and UK have aggressive anti-covid stimulus programmes + the usual money printing so I guess that would be on par?

Following on from my post the other day regarding backtests and my experience of going live with a system I came up with in order to see if the system holds up in December (I will link that at the end of the post), I have decided to go ahead and take the next step in progression with a larger account in 2021.

The plan for now is to try and maintain the same level of execution while not letting the $ amounts in the account phase me, which with the power of my backtesting results to encourage me, I think I will manage just fine.

As you can see, the new account has started off with a loss (ofcourse) : [https://imgur.com/a/yd0iSkd](https://imgur.com/a/yd0iSkd) but I do have some good trades that are in profit running in the background (as shown by the 'equity' number on the screenshot.

The goal is to double the account equity whenever I gain 20% on the initial equity (however long that takes), which would mean I have a 10% buffer on the new balance (ie When this 25k becomes 30k, I will deposit an additional 25k into the account to bring the new total to 55k). Ofcourse with the caveat that I wont be depositing during an obvious period of over-performance, which I would let revert to the mean with a period of underperformance before an actual deposit (providing the account balance still has a 10% buffer for the new balance after the underperforming period). Ofcourse I dont have an infinite amount of money sitting around so it will keep doubling until I cant deposit anymore.

This will prob be my last post regarding this for abit, as I dont want to spam the subreddit with my stuff all the time. I will probably do a quarterly update or something in April.

Wishing you all the best with all your goals in 2021!

I found my next setup, placed the entry, and price kept going up toward my TP but I had not yet been triggered into the trade. I thought about cancelling my entry, I thought about just entering the market to try and get in while it's on the way up. But instead I trusted my strategy, left my emotions out of it, and let the trade play out. The price eventually fell again back to my Entry point, dipped toward my SL only 4 Pips, then shot upward. I woke up this morning with a Take Profit notification. I entered it into my journal, then scanned the market for my next entry.

While I didnt have zero emotions toward the trade, I am glad that I was able to identify when my emotions were trying to interfere with my strategy, put them aside, and just trust in my strategy.

Week Chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/4AEMwymS/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4AEMwymS/)

Not much to add here, we can clearly see that the trend is down so we will be looking for a short bias. The introduction of the new variant of covid + lockdowns will no doubt play in JPY favour. On an another note, XAUUSD has broken out of a long term 4h CTL and heading upwards towards 2080. For the newbies, we generally see inverse correlatoion between XAUSD and USDJPY. Confirm our short bias.

1H Chart:  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/CJ3LWhLF/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CJ3LWhLF/)

the pair had a slight uptick towards the end of 2020. we can see that the pair began to sink south after presenting a M formation. we can now see price running below various MA's.

The pair created a channel pulling back towards the MA's. After a period of accumulation we saw a breakout. The pair has retraced back to the CTL, where we are going to execute a short with a classic break and retest of a CTL. Ideally I wanted to the entry and 103.25 where there is a clear engulf candle to the left but this isn't pokemon (dont need to catch em all). So i'm slightly late to the move (10pips).

Confirmations include, RSI, MA, Price action on the W and D.

Lets get 'em.

Edit / Update: trade in nice profit and we have seen a new low. Expect to see a retrace tomorrow before the next drive down to TP.

I have some $$ invested in stocks and my home country's currency is EUR, but my owned stocks are denominated in USD. So if USD falls against EUR -- that offsets my gains quite a bit.

So I was thinking of hedging that with EUR/USD options. And I wanted to ask you, more experienced investors if my logic is correct (I've never traded options before).

**So here goes:**

I wanna insure my \~$100,000 USD against possible depreciation against EUR.  
So I would buy a **EUR call / USD put @ strike price of $1.22.**

Let's say after 6 months, **the EUR/USD trades @ $1.28.**  
As a result, I can sell my stocks and get \~$100,000 in cash. Then I exercise my option **which lets me buy $100,000 worth of EUR for $1.22 (?).**

Am I correct on this?

I'm an American earning USD who is planning to live part-time in the Eurozone once this pandemic crap is over, hopefully starting in Fall '21 (but Spring '22 if things stay ugly).

Right now the EUR is entering... shall we say, uncomfortable territory for me if I'm going to be paying some rent and life expenses in EUR while continuing to earn USD.

Should I:

* Buy some EUR now as a hedge? If so, where can I learn how to buy and store them cheaply?
* Mess with options?
* Do nothing, as my saved USD are earning a pretty decent return?

Of course I'll be happy to elaborate as needed.

EDIT: Thanks for your comments!

To begin with, its price action only. No indicators, because those are lagging which is no help while scalping. It tries to combine 2 different approaches. And im searching for a way improve it, its probability  for example.

&#x200B;

Symbols : EURUSD, GBPUSD

Timeframe : 5 Minute and 1 Minute as a ""supporting"" timeframe

RR : 1/2 and above only

In advance : Determine the last few support and resistance levels ( 2 and more hits ), none should be older than half a day. When theres a trend on the 5 minute frame, then only trade within its direction.

&#x200B;

Trading the support and resistance

The first style is that we simply trade the support and the resistance. Therefore we need proper candle stick actions on those levels and a good reaction with the s/r itself. So we either trade a reversal or an breaktrough. We always enter once such a confirmation candle occurs. Our take profit and stop loss is set to areas of former high confluence. If those dont exist... we simply choose ""good"" looking spots that are a few pips above/under the entry point. Shouldnt be too tight and not too lose. The RR matters. Two little examples.

Short reversal ( Range market )

The price was approaching a resistance, had a good reaction with it and reversed. The sl is set a few pips above the level and the take profit into an area of former consoldation.

[Slowing candles, reaction, confirmation](https://preview.redd.it/fku2nehfak961.png?width=1460&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d2bd24e72b1de6868d47f7867778763abd62778)

Long breaktrough ( Trend continuation )

The price approached a former higher high ( we are in a 5 minute uptrend ) so we are looking for long positions. The price broke trough and we on a retest to avoid false breakouts. The S/R can either be a real s/r where the price bounced of several times... but it also mostly works for trend continuations. Another solution is to buy the dip once the pullback starts to bounce back. 

&#x200B;

[Fast breaktrough, retest, confirmation](https://preview.redd.it/izelqsgeak961.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=940dd35675a891e2a0a3b3d548e98084c8ab531d)

This ""works"" so far... in one of my ""tests"" i had a sucessrate of somewhere between 50% and 60%. So i tried to increase my strategy... for more opportunities  and a higher probability. But im not sure if thats really worth or even possible. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My thoughts about possible additions

Buying the dip, aka... waiting for a pullback to buy/sell it. I tried to use fibo's for buying the dip at certain levels, but this didnt always worked due to the high volatility. Means that there often was no confirmation at those levels and fakeouts often occured. Do you think its worth to add this instead of waiting for a breakout of the last higher high ? If so, how exactly do we do this ? Just price action ? Fibbo ? Other tools ? 

Trendlines... no idea what i should think about them. I tried them without this strategy a couple of times and they generate many false signals. I used them for trading signals instead of pure assistance. So i sold once it broke or waited for a retest or bounce on those levels. But this mostly failed due to fakeouts or i thought the trend ended, but it still continued a few minutes after the trendline was broken. Should we use them for assistance only ? For entry signals ? A mix of both ? 

Any other ideas what could improve the probability of winning signals in this strategy ? Or increase the amount of signals while keeping the same probability ? 

Im glad for any help on this topic :)","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/eMR9M2odPVRQ_GSIO_IoGcA8L-kFumZLO-2iWyJBZUA.jpg","https://redd.it/kr558t"

I like to close my positions before midnight when I'm in profits above 1:1 R:R. This is because I'm not good at sleeping on an open trade that's already sitting in profits. Last night, I didn't and it cost me around 100 pips of missed opportunity.

At around noon yesterday price entered my setup. It floated within my risk tolerance range and triggered the trade. After a bit of fight it eventually broke to lower lows before losing steam and fluctuating past midnight and into the start of the London session. I didn't want to miss the bigger move I had anticipated and wanted to monitor the ground I had already covered so I regrettably stayed up to watch and see what happened.

After a couple hours I became tired. Combine that with some unpredictable fundamentals the next day (senate Ga elections), and the arriving liquidity of the European traders I convinced myself to close at +35 pips around 2:30am.

That long night however, caused me to sleep through the same setup I had taken yesterday which garnered the exact move I was looking for. Lesson learned. TRUST YOUR ANALYSIS and be conscious of your tendencies. I didn't stick to my routine by closing before midnight and I also didn't commit to holding the position into the next day. No plan breeds subjectivity. Should have committed one way or the other and went to bed. Oh well, on to the next. I hope this new year brings lots of pips to you all.

This also assumes you know how to read candles, price action, and support and resistance.

This mostly covers entries to small trends, but can be used for scalping too. Works on 1h and 4h.

Risk/Reward should reflect the time frame you're using the idea on.

1) If price is above 200 ema, only look for entries. if below, look for sells.
2) Only look to entry when adx is above 20 (approaching 25)
3) Only look to enter when lower lows/higher highs are created on the donchian channels
4) If D- and D+ cross while above the 25 Adx (Adx should still be above 25)

Now although I do accept this as fact, I’m having troubles grasping why this is true. Allow me to elaborate.

I’m going to preface this by saying that I am a beginner when it comes to forex trading and that this is simply my thought process with regards to this question.

So say somebody knows absolutely nothing about trading and decides to hop into the market. If they place a random trade (buy or sell) with an equally sized TP and SL, in theory they should have ~ 50% odds of coming out of the trade profitable no? (I’d assume slightly lower odds due to pair spreads and commissions).

With this in mind. Wouldn’t something as simple as trend following or basic support and resistance based trading be enough to give you a small edge in the market? Just enough to cover the cost of spreads and commissions and still have a slight edge? 

Something that comes to mind when thinking about this is card counters in casinos. With perfect card counting, their odds of winning are only between 51% and 53.5%, just a slight edge, yet this is more than enough to make card counters profitable.

Please forgive my ignorance, but I could really use some help in determining where my logic goes wrong. Obviously with the statistics I’m hearing about failed traders my logic must be flawed somewhere.","self","https://redd.it/ks8nqw"

Heres what I'm wondering... What strategies, tools, ""rules of thumb,"" tips, patterns have you learned about or developed, tried out and learned from your practice DIDNT WORK FOR YOU?

Things that you purposefully implimented in your strategies and found that they more often than not didn't result in sucess?

I'm hoping this could be a good post becuase folks can share their experiences and we could hopefully learn from all of that...

I'm just starting out and am positively saturating myself in books (mostly downloading what I beleive are the most important, Murphy and the like), articles, vlogs, podcasts, all the things.... in addition to learning from a good freind of mine. I have made absolutely 0 trades, I have signed up for practice accounts and am teaching myself to read charts and to use brokerages tools, and am still learning the lingo and many aspects of all fo this....

So it seems I AM finding alot of solid and clearly shared insights/teachings but also plenty of divergent opinions and specific strategies. Tips and advice that may be great or may be garbage!

I know full well that this is the nature of the beast as no one has ""perfect solutions"" especially becuase this is economics, with psychological feedback loops involved of people outsmarting the outsmarters and seeking to perfect their practice in an area with built in uncertainty... but because of all that it is clear that folks are trying all manner of different specific peices of their strategies, and learning from their mistakes as they should!

&#x200B;

And so that seems to imply that sucess in Forex and in TA trading naturally involves smart and methodological trial and error.

&#x200B;

To be clear I'm asking about specific TA strategy rather than focus on psychological discipline in managing risk, though of course they are intertwined. That is to say I am curious about things like specific use chart patterns in predicting trends, use of charting tools and indicators in particular ways,  finding entry and exit strategies, focusing on specific time scale charts that DIDNT WORK FOR YOU,... that kind of thing, rather than the (of course quite valuable to learn from otherwise)topics of ""I failed to impliment my strategy due to panic and FOMO"" in folks experiance... In other words I think it would be awesome to focus on/learn about TA strategy pitfalls and appreciate and learn about the psychological failures of risk management and impulsiveness in other venues...

Another area I'm very interested in is quantitive and statistical analysis, so if anyone wants to go into that stuff I'd love to hear it but it may be beyond the scope of this post....

&#x200B;

So yeah, I'm sure yall might have some insight into this ""bad practices"" question, again if this is innapropriate for this sub I totally understand, just appreciate any response or answers in advance!

This for me leads to a spinning mind and confusion, for some reason I can't focus on trading more than 1 pair even two and I begin to lose focus. Which one do I enter? Where is my money going to be better off today? etc. My shift from being a confused and unprofitable trader came  when I decided to focus on only one pair being EUR/USD. Since then I am very comfortable trading Forex and I take around 2-4 entries and week and that's all I need. Some people may say well trading more pairs equals more pips and that is true if you are taking multiple entries, but multiple entries means more risk as well correct? My questions are if you are trading/watching multiple pairs (2+), why do you do it and how has it shaped you into the trader you are today? How many did you start trading/watching when you started vs now?","self","https://redd.it/ksip1f"

On Jan 5th price made a high of the day that can be better seen on the 5 Min chart. Price tested this level twice after it was made. On Jan 6th price ran above that level as well as the previous weekly high with speed and seemingly out of no where to some. This is what I believe to be a stop run as well as tricking breakout traders into entering. After this price dropped by 48 pips then continued to rally for a greater half of the rest of the day. Stopping out current traders who are short and having new traders enter in long before price sells off. Manipulation as its finest. What do you guys think? BTW the yellow line is the high from Jan 5th and the blue line is the previous weekly high. :)

As we can see we are in a major downtrend on the one minute timeframe. The chart is making lower lows. But then suddenly we see something unexpected... no ""lower low""... the price actually bounced off on that unexpected support.

Is this still a downtrend ?

So what exactly does this tell us ? Did the downtrend end ? Does this increase the possibility for an upcoming up trend ? 

Which trend should we follow or focus on, the old downtrend or the new broken trend ?","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Y05EIst1F7tm501-kh8D2BdCikkq2fYLWaLXxHxt6EI.jpg","https://redd.it/kslct8"

I am using Forex Tester 4, which tracks the dollar value of trades. I am trying to convert these dollar values into R values so that I can determine my R:R, my return in R over certain periods, etc.

The trade history shows entry price, Stop Loss price and Take Profit price. So I am calculating Risk by getting the absolute value of the entry price minus the Stop Loss. I am calculating Reward the same way, except using TP instead of SL. I am dividing pipettes Risked by the pipettes of Reward to get the R:R ratio. I am doing this for each trade, and tracking these numbers in three columns in Microsoft Excel.

Then, I am summing up the total pips of Risk and total pips of Reward, for all trades, and getting the ratio of those two numbers to see the cumulative R:R across all trades. HOWEVER, when I get the average of the R:R figure in each row, the average R:R does not match the R:R figure that I get by getting the ratio of pips of Risk to pips of Reward. 

&#x200B;

[On the left: total pipettes of risk and reward. On the top-right, the average of the R:R values tracked in the cell above. On the bottom-right, the ratio of total pipettes risked to total pipettes of reward.](https://preview.redd.it/p8ngjc91i7a61.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3ed3e232b2433a0fec74128350a10bd890fb78)

I am not a mathematically-inclined person by any means, so I can't figure this out. The amount of pipettes risked/won ends in 0.46, so is this all because of floating point errors?

I am trying to use the R:R to calculate my expectancy. When I calculate my expectancy in R Values, I am getting a negative value. When I use the average win (in dollars) and average loss (in dollars) to calculate my expectancy, I am getting a positive value. Don't these have to match? My strategy is clearly profitable when I simulate thousands of trades over 11 years.

I appreciate the help. Hopefully this post also helps others understand what these basic statistics are.","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2cxWnDDQJC8-ED2RsUv8Vx1_eN_yLh5aR6tIKCNZEck.jpg","https://redd.it/ktgm4c"

I have spent Friday testing a day trading strategy on the H1 on GBPAUD that I have created. It's nothing extremely original, I wanted to keep it simple.  I also wanted to try and create something with a good win rate that happens frequently enough. First, I will explain the rules of the strategy, and then I will share my back tested results. The only indicators and tools you will need are a 50 EMA and a Fibonacci Retracement tool. Here are my fib settings on trading view: 0, 0.618, 1, -0.25, -0.618, 0.5, 0.786. As most of you know, the zone between the 0.5 and the 0.618 is the ""Golden Zone"", we will be using that zone for our entry. 

First things first, you'll want to identify your ""key levels"" on the weekly or daily time frame. The definition of a ""key level"" for this specific strategy is a general price area that has been tested *at least* twice, and that has moved the market significantly in doing so. 

**RULES:**

1. Price ***MUST*** be trending above (uptrend) or below (downtrend) the 50 EMA. It can also and will often be bouncing off of it. If price *breaks* above or below the 50 EMA, you **must** have a 1, 2, 3 (or A, B, C) move to classify a new trend. 1 is the push in the direction of the trend, 2 is a pullback, and 3 is the continuation of the trend. 


2. If price is approaching a key level that we identified on the weekly or daily time frame, we watch how price reacts to it before taking a trade. We are either looking for a bounce off of it, or a break through. If we get a bounce off and a move in the opposite direction, we wait for a 1, 2, 3 move again to classify a new trend. This is just here to be conscious about how a major level can affect this strategy. 


3. While we are trending above or below the 50 EMA, draw the Fibonacci Retracement tool from the ***PUSH*** to the new low or high.  The *push* can be tough to spot/define. The *push* must create a new high or low before pulling back. When it pulls back, the push is over, and you draw your Fibonacci from the start of the push, to where it ended and is now pulling back. The *push* can be either the first or the third leg of your 1, 2, 3 move. 


4. If the push makes a new high or low, and the pullback from the push rejects the ""Golden Zone""; which is on or in between the 0.50 and the 0.618 extension, **ENTER!** A rejection is defined as a wick off of our ""Golden Zone"". Enter on an **engulfing candle** or a **hammer** or **shooting star** candle. If you want to be more aggressive, don't wait for the candle stick pattern. Enter as soon as you get a rejection and a close off of the ""Golden Zone"". Hammer or shooting star is most aggressive, engulfing is a little less aggressive than that, and the least aggressive is waiting for both a hammer or shooting star and an engulfing candle. However, the closer your entry to the ""Golden Zone"", the better the risk to reward ratio. Pick your poison.


5. Stop loss **ALWAYS** goes on or above or below the 0.786 extension. If you want a wider stop loss, you can put it on or above or below the 1 (100%) extension, as long as your risk to reward ratio is ***at least*** 1:1. Take profit **ALWAYS** goes on the -0.618 extension.


6. You ***MUST*** ***ALWAYS*** have ***at least*** a 1:1 risk to reward ratio. If you do not, you do not take the trade. 

**BACKTESTED RESULTS: (GBPAUD H1)**

* **Timeframe:** January 29th, 2020 - January 8th 2021
* **Winrate:** 56/82 = 68%
* **Average Risk to Reward Ratio:** 1:2.75

I plan on testing this on other pairs throughout the week as well, I’m currently testing it on NZDUSD and it’s looking even more promising than GBPAUD. I took just about every single opportunity it gave me, and was objective about the results. I know this is kind of a high win rate, but if you don’t believe me you can test it yourself. Constructive criticism is appreciated.","self","https://redd.it/ku4x3y"

Risking about 3-4% (high I know, but my winrate allows and currently trying to grow aggressively before I pull back risk percentage a bit) I was awakening to the previous night of trading deleting my orders because I didn’t have enough margin. Which is a real pain in the ass, because looking through IGs margin requirements for us citizens were among 3-4% required! That’s less than 1:50! (Unless I’m misunderstanding). And that’s a real bummer, because I missed out on some serious profits! Any ideas on ways to improve this? I know I can just risk less (1% or less). Which is my plan going forward, but you can’t blame a guy with a good winrate and good r:r ratio for wanting to fast track his growth, such as taking 3-5% on a trade depending on how good the setup is. 

TL:DR, shit US broker laws, ways around? Literally 1:25 margin for some pairs on IG?","self","https://redd.it/ku9ri4"

The most obvious reason is that you don't learn anything from just copying and pasting numbers from a signal service straight into your MT4 app without understanding why a trade is being taken. Sure some services do actually post their analysis but the people who are looking for these services are usually the ones too lazy to read the analysis anyway (let alone do their own research) hence why they are looking for a signal service in the first place.

Every service I've tried in the past uses pips gained to measure their performance along with multiple TP's and there is a very good reason for this. Firstly, number of pips gained or lost during a trade bears no correlation to profit/loss. You can make 1k from 10 pips or 100 pips all depending on lot size and the forex pair you are trading - number of pips is mostly irrelevant in measuring trading performance. 

Secondly, (and more importantly) is the multiple TP levels you will usually see these services use. Take the example signal below:

EURAUD

SELL AT: 1.61000

SL: 1.61500

TP1: 1.60800

TP2: 1.60400

TP3: 1.60000

You have 2 options on how to place the above trade. First option is to make one trade and pick a TP level depending on how confident you (or the signal service) is in the trade. Problem with this strategy is that when it comes to reporting the performance of this trade the signal service will simply pick the TP the trade hit (if any). This means that if you decide to go for TP3 but the trade only makes it to TP1 then reverses and hits SL the signal service will (in this case) report the trade as +20 pips but you actually suffered a -50 pip loss. I have yet to see a signal service report a trade as lost when the first TP has been hit and then reversed to hit SL.

Ok, so you think to yourself well I'll just go for TP1 on each trade to play it safe. Problem here is that the SL is usually (much) further away from the entry point than TP1 and therefore your Risk/Reward ratio is backwards - i.e. you are risking more than you stand to gain if the trade wins and therefore unless the win rate is very, very good you will lose over the long term. In the example above the SL is 50 pips away while TP1 is only 20 pips away.

The other option (and this is what the signal service will usually recommend) is to split your trade into however many TP level's there are. So if you were going to risk 3 lots on the trade above on a single trade, instead you split that into 3 x 1 lot trades, 1 trade for each TP level with the same SL. You think to yourself great, I'm still risking the same amount of capital as before but now I can make use of all 3 TP's. Problem is again what happens when the trade reaches TP1 then reverses and hits SL? The signal service reports a +20 pip gain but you've just lost -100 pips (-50 pips on the other 2 x trades). Yeh you could move the stops of your other 2 trades to BE when the first TP is hit but to do this with multiple trades in a volatile market your going to either have to watch your trading app constantly or set alerts all over the place. In my experience this was impossible to do while keeping a day job. TP1 was just always too close to the entry point which gave me very little time to move the stops of the other trades.

Ultimately it all comes down to testing these services for yourself to see if they work for you. Before signing up to a service all I urge you to do is look at their past performance and more importantly how they post their results before handing over any of your hard earned.

Full disclosure I do actually still use one of these services but not for their signals (for the reasons posted above) but for their algo's which have been fairly solid for me over the past year.","self","https://redd.it/kulps4"

Why is no one doing this ..?","Questions",0.67,4,0,0,28,0,"Ok so I’ve been scalping and one thing I noticed is. Little $1 and $2 profits add up. If you get 100 $1 trades, you have $100. 

Putting this in practice, scalping the highs and lows 30 mins a day, I ended up at $250 profit ($50 a day). 

This went well... until I went live and the emotions kicked in.  I’d lose profits both panic selling and holding trades for too long. And cause of how fast scalping is.. those emotions led me to blow an $80 account. 

So. Afterwards, I was thinking at work. I was like. If that actually made me $250 profit, then something was done correct, right ? 

What could it have been? I know I lost a lot of money off of not putting stop losses (obv, before you build wealth you first have to secure it), but I can’t ignore the fact that I made $250. 

Then, after my manager yelled at me for daydreaming, it hit me.

It’s the little profits that add up. It’s just if I’m putting trades in on the fly, anything can go and I won’t have any defenses against it. 

So then. Once again. After my manager asked if I’m ok, I came up with something that’s so crazy it just might work. Ready? Here:


Load MT4 with 50 different stocks, exotics, etc. doesn’t matter if they correlate or not, just have 50 of them loaded.  


Wait until it’s heading in a strong direction on the stochastic. 

Then put a limit order at a dollar per pip and get 2 pips (how the fuck can you miss two pips ..?) on each individual one throughout the day. 

And you have $100 now  

time consuming asf. But it dramatically reduces the risk I was taking originally. 

The idea also kinda came from the fact that there’s a $1 dollar shop up the street from me. I was telling myself if I buy 500 items for a dollar and sell for $2, I now have $1000. And if up to half of them fail to sell, I won’t lose any money. 

Whereas if I buy one item for $500, I have to sell it for $1000. And if I don’t, I lost a whole $500. 

The safe route 


But nobody seems to be doing this. Is there something I’m missing ? 

I feel like it’s because folks want to get rich quick, not to let pocket change add up...but i might be wrong.


Edit:  yeah there’s no way to do this without mastering a ton of pairs. And by that time I could’ve just mastered a few and could be bringing in way more profit so. Nvm","self","https://redd.it/kv8h2s"

I'll leave the fundamentals out of this. Please see [my low effort top down analysis here](https://imgur.com/a/hz05TfF)

We are currently trading well within __monthly supply zone__, the first image there shows how deep price entered the zone. 

Price closed within the zone, now showing bearish signs as last week we can see on the __weekly__ (second image) - price closed as a _bearish engulfing_ candle with wicks from above. This is another sign sellers are interested in coming in. 
Now though, price seems to be attempting to rally back up from the weekly **RBR** demand (short term)

The __daily chart__ like I've already posted on Sunday shows a structure has been broken and we are interested in looking to sell this pair. This is shown also by the __bearish engulfing candle__ (_see daily chart image_) at the very top of the recent high followed by the strong bearish candles. 

H4 is giving us an idea/_confluence_ that a reversal may be taking place (__Quasimodo Structure__). This gives us an idea of how big/small the zone is supposed to be and should it be violated - we know that our bias was invalidated. 

The targets though are at a short term demand zone around ~1.98. The overall macro trend is still showing bullish signs on the EUR/USD pair. 

Looking at the __USD Index__, we can see that we're at a short/midterm demand zone which isn't as fresh/strong anymore. Demand levels are more interesting below these levels, which further solidifies our bias (please refer to your USDX charts).

I decided to write this out because of a lot of good people coming to this sub, thinking forex is some magical profession where knowing a good strategy is all it takes. To me, comments like ""put some pics and strategy"" or ""strategy or fake"" posts are equivalent to a 20 year old CSGO player trying to talk war to a bunch of scarfaces who have SL lashed on their backs. But I was one of them. And I know there are people who mean well in those questions, and that is why we can discuss that here.

Understand that nobody is inclined to answer those questions. It's insulting. People spent months, years working on them, sleepless nights, I myself sacrificed my hobbies so I could practise trading every day after work. Some paid well over their yearly salary for someone to teach them. And someone here wants to say ""if your profits are so good, post your detailed strategy or you are fake"". Yeah you wont find a cheering crowd for yourself buddie.

And finding a good strategy isn't hard at all. A great deal of strategies work. All you need to do is go to youtube, reddit (or anywhere you can find a detailed strategy explained), pick one, learn it, and **backtest it.** I recommend going back up to 1 year, 2 max. To the people that think ""oh this is a lot of work, I just wanted to come here and grab some easy cash"" you can leave right now and thank me for saving you from financial loss and possibly depression.

Got stuck on your strategy for whatever reason? That is when you should come here and ask! Post what you did, say ""my problem is here"" or ""what can I do better in my system"" and you will get people with 15+ years of experience talk to you! Millionaires you couldn't meet in person over a million years, talking to you in their spare time!

Understand that **trading is a profession.** And professionals have standards. Dont come in here thinking you can swing a golf club and be the next Tiger Woods of trading. That's why this profession is plagued by fake gurus. It's easy to put on a winning trade. If you approach this as your entrepreneurship, willing to put in the sweat and tears to learn it and grow it, you will have a wonderful experience.","self","https://redd.it/kvpw1z"

I'm not necessarily looking for tips/signals, as I don't think they're reliable (If anyone has tested proven winner please share lol), but somewhere to get a reliable outlook on the day ahead/behind and maybe key levels. 


I find fxstreet quite good, yahoo finance ( although not as many updated articles compared to the rest) and daily fx to be ok. 
I like trading view to quickly look at technicals but don't pay much notice to ideas as anyone can post. 


I used financial times for a bit but don't think the information is good enough to warrant the cost. 

Does anyone have any experience with Bloomberg? Is it worth it?

Can it pay of to exchange via a third currency? And I don’t mean waiting for a better rate and make a profit, I mean to get the most out of a simple exchange.

For example, I have a bank account in Norway, Sweden and USA. I want to exchange NOK to USD. When using the currency calculator in each bank I get the following results:  

Alternative 1:  
1000 NOK = __118.23 USD__  

Alternative 2:  
1000 NOK = 982.41 SEK
982.41 SEK = __119.40 USD__  

Of course it will include some fees and the rates will change during the transactions but if we just ignore all that, does it mean it pay of to transfer via my Swedish bank?

My EA profits nicely over 11 years of data from one currency pair. But I think I have overfit the parameters of my EA. 

In r/algotrading, they recommend testing the strategy on a sample of data that I did not use to backtest/optimize. People are saying that the EA should be able to work on a different set of data from the same currency pair, or on other trading pairs entirely, without any modification, in order to be considered a successful strategy. 

However, I have also seen people in r/Forex say that an edge can disappear over time. Some say that their own EAs may only last for a year or two before failing to profit. I have seen others say that their EAs have been running for years, but require occasional adjustment. Others have said that the market may suddenly start exhibiting different behaviors than it did before, and never return to the old state.

I am having trouble reconciling the very academic approach to statistical analysis offered by r/algotrading with the testimonials I have seen elsewhere. 

My EA worked well for the first 11 years of data for one trading pair, but it didn't do well in the 9 years prior to that. The EA did do well on a different trading pair--but using somewhat different parameters than I did for the first trading pair. Note that with the first trading pair I could adjust the parameters up and down in a wide range and still achieve similar results, whereas with the second pair there is a much narrower band of parameters that lead to success. But how narrow is too narrow of a range of success? Is all of this enough for me to conclude that I have overfitted the strategy and must try something else? Does trying something else mean throwing out this strategy and its thesis entirely?","self","https://redd.it/kw6t9y"

When I first decided to narrow my focus I wanted to watch all 3 pairs but eventually I only focused on 2 pairs, NU & AJ. Granted these pairs have been trending pretty
well lately the main take away for me was focusing on a smaller number of pairs forced me to be patient and wait for my optimal set up. Not only did I become more patient I got to know the pairs very well and discovered their nuances and even incorporated those details into my trading plan. 

A month of trading is in no way a large enough sample size to say my trading plan works or not but my trading psychology greatly improved because of this. I realized that by clicking through 8 - 10 pairs at a time I was literally just gambling and chasing trades instead of letting them come to me. Trading forex really does reveal your mental inadequacies, I was impulsive and honestly started to develop somewhat of an addiction.

2. a formula for pairs whose base currency is my account currency, ie, pairs starting with USD. Examples: USDJPY, USDCAD, USDTRY, USDCHF, etc.

3. a formula for cross pairs, ie, pairs that do not have USD in their symbol. Examples, GBPJPY, EURGBP, etc.

- riskPercent = 4%
- stopLoss = 4 pips
- spread = 1.5 pips
- commission = 3 USD per standard lot.

I am about to finish up the verification process with FTMO on the $25K account. This has been a 5 year journey for me and I am finally becoming profitable as a trader.

That being said, I want to be looking ahead and make sure to minimize my taxes and maximize my gains. I live in the US in PA. I'm currently a W2 salary employee and don't plan to quit my job, but after research I'm guessing I should start an LLC. With FTMO, to get your 70% profit share, you have to invoice them, which I would do from my LLC (once I create it). I guess the main questions are- is that the best way to do this, should I just hire a CPA (suggestions?), and are any of you trading for FTMO/how are you paying your taxes (if you are US based)?

&#x200B;

Thanks for any help you can offer and hope you are bagging mad pips!

This is my understanding so far:

Most retail traders trade CFD's (contract for differences) on platforms such as MT4 with a broker and essentially bet on the way the price moves. No currency is ever actually exchanged.

Example of typical trade: 
You order a CFD contract with your broker to buy USD/JPY. Your broker agrees to your contract but instead of taking it themselves they match your order with a counterparty who wants to sell USD/JPY. This could be anyone on the CFD market, wether that's another retail trader or a large financial institution. 

You can then keep the CFD contract open for however long you wish. When you attempt to close your trade, the broker matches you with another counterparty (likely someone different than when you opened) and the contract ends. The broker has effectively fulfilled its contract with you using other traders' CFD orders. The broker never had to use its own money and instead made profit through spreads and fees. 

Exchange rates are based on the spot market where large financial institutions trade large volumes of currency with each other. 

Fluctuations in exchange rate can lead to loss or profit. Whenever a profit is made someone is taking a loss. It is a zero sum game in which the majority of retail traders end up losing money to large banks. These banks have great influence over exchange rates and are very active in the FX spot market (reserved for large financial institutions) and CFD market (where day traders hang out).

The CFD market is its own subsection of forex, separate but related to things such as the FX spot market or currency futures/options, for example.

Please let me know if I've got anything wrong. Thanks.

EDIT: And how is spread betting different from this?","self","https://redd.it/kxi1zc"

I must admit, this is a bit outside of my wheelhouse, so excuse me if this sounds dumb

Let's say I'm a US investor with USD. I exchange some of my money to INR and purchase Indian government bonds yielding 6% or so a year. This would be nice, but of course there's 'exchange risk' (or whatever it's called) if the value of INR were to change relative to USD  

My question is, could we use the USD/INR pair to hedge this 'exchange risk', ensuring I keep my interest? If so, how would you go about figuring how much to buy/short? Is there a name for this?  

My assumption is that the additional capital required for the forex trade would reduce the return from the bonds significantly, but with leverage, who knows?

I am still trading the Bands strategy posted here a while back - among another system that's still in the backtesting phase. I've started a new account at the beginning of the year, and so far I have encountered six valid trades. I'll give you a brief rundown of these trades and then I'll talk about the point of this thread.

* First trade was a GBPUSD Long, on the 6th of January, formed on the 8h timeframe. The entry was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NNeUmzMN/) and the exit was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KqYPQ8zD/). It resulted in a loss of 1R.
* Second trade was an EURCHF Long, on the 6th of January, formed on the Daily timeframe. The entry was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9ZTw4fDP/) and the exit was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bv0eBxhA/). It resulted in a win of 1.80R.
* Third trade was a USDCAD Short, on the 7th of January, formed on the 6H timeframe. The entry was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FXbDIBQj/) and the exit was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9emfkwwt/). It resulted in a loss of 1R.
* Fourth trade was a NZDJPY Short, on the 11th of January, formed on the Daily timeframe. The entry was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/opJKefwa/) and the exit was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/35a2z4At/). It resulted in a win of 1.80R. However, this was the longest trade I held so far, and it closed last - this will become important later.
* Fifth trade was a GBPUSD Long, on the 11th of January, formed on the 8H timeframe. The entry was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1BNnS4nD/) and the exit was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XWdZ7ARY/). It resulted in a win of 1.80R.
* Sixth, and final, trade was a EURUSD Long, on the 12th of January, formed on the 12H timeframe. The entry was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WTBaCKiG/) and the exit was [here](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Dhw5yqrj/). It resulted in a loss of 1R.

So, to recap, for the first two weeks of the year I have encountered 6 valid trades, 3 of which would have won, 3 would have lost, for a winrate of 50% and average reward of 1.8R, for a net profit of 2.4R. That's an expectancy of 0.40R per trade and a profit factor of 1.80. **Statistically, this is meaningless because of the small sample size**. I only need this to use it as comparison to how my trading actually went.

The problem is that I did not take all the valid trades.

Trade number 2 and trade number 5 were skipped. I talked myself out of them, because the previous trade was a loss and I was scared. I was able to rationalize it, but in hindsight, those trades fit my plan and should have been entered.

So, how does my performance look like without those two trades?

* Trade 1: Loss of 1R
* Trade 2: Loss of 1R
* Trade 3: Win of 1.80R
* Trade 4: Loss of 1R

For a net loss of -1.20R, a winrate of 25%, a profit factor of 0.6.

This is one of the 'concrete' evidences that a profitable strategy won't make you a profitable trader. I feel like there is a lot of fluff around trading psychology, and showing examples of how it manifests in reality should help you have a more realistic view of what the potential issues are.

What went wrong, and what was my mistake? My mistake was forgetting a fundamental fact about the market. Quoting Mark Douglas:

**Every moment in the market is unique.**

Probabilistic events do not have memory of previous events and do not influence the probability of future events.  There is a random distribution of wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. If you get ten heads in a row tossing a coin, the probability of the next toss being cross remains exactly the same. **I know this**, consciously, but I still fall for it subconsciously.

This is also one of the reasons signal services do not work. You need to participate in all the events derived from a system with a profitable edge, otherwise you're not going to take part in the full distribution of wins and losses that will, over time, give you a net profit.

We remain our biggest enemy.","self","https://redd.it/kyj6io"

Supporting the analysis:

RSI indicator with an upward trend above 60.00.

Support line above 50% Fibonacci at 1.88500

Resistance line in 10% Fibonacci tested and exceeded several times in the last hours.

MA 100 setting the trend perfectly.

Sustained upward trend from 1.86300

&#x200B;

To be taken into account:

The British gross domestic product with a better than expected average growth.

We conclude: that once the markets are open the price of #GBPNZD will continue its trend.

Recommended trade: We buy a high lot in a short and safe trade, opening up around 1.9000 with SL at 38% Fibonacci (1.8900) taking profit somewhere between 1.91300 and 1.91500.

First of all, have in mind this example; Growing from 100 to 200 requires a 100% gain. Going from 200 to 100 instead requires a 50% loss (part of the reason why crashes are more violent than bull markets)

Having this in mind, you must understand that you can’t lose more than 2% of your total capital per stop loss. This is the reason why trading with bigger accounts is always better. For example, if you are trading with a 10k capital you can set up a stop loss losing $100 and a take profit earning $300 (this would be a 3 to 1 risk reward ratio trade). 

Your must calculate your stop loss very well before entering the trade. There are plenty of free calculators that let you input these values and give you lot sizes according to your total capital.

Also, try to place your stop loss in candlesticks with price action. Help yourself identifying price action by spotting candle confirmations or spikes in volume.

Put it into practice today without risking your capital. There are plenty of free tools that let you add candlesticks from the past to test trading strategies. (Backtesting)

recently I came up with a new strategy for me to use, a strategy that feels natural, that feels very good. I backtested it, studied it over and over, backtested more than 100 trades on one pair and it works, it makes sense. I understand it and it works and therefore the only thing that can keep me from executing it on a live account is my psychology. Now I do not have a problem with psychology when it comes to live trading. (revenge trading, FOMO, etc...) I've only taken about 3 trades so far and unfortunately they did not work out, but I'm not sad about it, because I know I stuck to my rules of the strategy. 

But my question is. Whenever I'm trading, I feel completely fine, everything is clear. As soon as I stop looking at the charts, go live my life, or at night when going to sleep, my mind starts overthinking, doubting the strategy, doubting the whole Forex thing. Even tho I know the system works, I just feel like I lack the confidence. Did any of you have/had this feeling? The feeling that you are never going to make it in the markets, that even tho you stick to your rules, the trade will go against you? All of this doubting/lack of confidence? 

I love trading Forex, I really enjoy it and I'm giving it my all, because I know I will make it, but I still have my doubts, which I think is completely normal, but I just wanted to know your opinion or experience, if you feel like sharing. 

Have a nice day!","self","https://redd.it/l07379"

I want to lay down my thinking process and then come up with the rules and steps for the trading system so that you will understand it better.

I am sure everyone would have made this observation that if you buy low or sell high, you will make a profit. This is the foundation of every single trading system there exists.

So we now have our **Rule 1:** **Buy the Dips and Sell the Peaks**

*NOTE: Here, Dips indicate short-term retracement* *to the downside and Peaks indicate short-term retracement to the upside.*

Now, if we just randomly start buying when the market dips, then we might get stopped out because it would be in a strong downtrend and even if we don't get stopped out, we would be stuck in consolidation for a long time. It might also result in small profits and big losses.

This is why we should always Buy the Dips in an Uptrend and Sell the Peaks in a Downtrend.

So, our modified **Rule 1: Buy the Dips in an Uptrend and Sell the Peaks in a Downtrend**

Now, according to Rule 1, we have to find out those markets that are in a strong trend, right? How will you do that? It is also simple, just look at the Daily and Weekly TFs and figure out if the candles are moving up or down or sideways. If they were moving sideways for a long time, you need to discard those markets right away. If the markets on Daily and Weekly TFs are in an uptrend, then it is called a **strong uptrend** and vice-versa.

Next, after we have shortlisted the trending pairs (max 5 pairs recommended), our next task according to Rule 1 is to wait for a **Dip in an Uptrend or a Peak in a Downtrend.** This is, by far, the most difficult part of trading. The patience required by a trader to wait for the market to start its Dip or Peak and wait for it to end before entering a trade is priceless. It cannot be bought from someone or developed overnight. It requires experience and the right mindset.

Now, let's say you have the patience for the markets to start their retracement i.e. a move against the trend, our next obvious problem according to Rule 1 would be to figure out if a retracement is about to end or not.

So for that, we use technical tools like support-resistance (S/R) and trendlines (TL). These are the common ones. Everyone uses them. So, we will use them too. Draw out the nearest 2 TLs in the direction of the trend on the 4H and Daily TF only. If it is an uptrend, mark the prior low such that if it gets broken, the entire uptrend gets invalidated and vice-versa. These markings of TL and S/R determine the position of the market with respect to the trend. It helps in gauging if the markets are high or low. So for example, if the price is near a TL or prior low in an uptrend, we know that it is at a low point. This is when we look for a buy.

Along with them, we will use a 50 EMA which should be used only on the 1H TF. In an uptrend, if the price is below the 50 EMA, then only you are allowed to buy. But you are not allowed to enter yet.

One more factor is missing. And it is **the Timing**. This is the deciding factor whether you should enter the trade or not. As many of you know that the London-New York Overlap (LN Overlap) is the most volatile time of the day, you should consider entering the trade only during that overlap. Why? It is because, during the non-volatile time of the day, the markets tend to be controlled by algorithmic trading robots who take the price near zones of high liquidity i.e. stop-loss clusters ([Reference](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/08/forex-trading-schedule-trading-times.asp)). This is why markets may generate false signals before the overlap and move in the opposite direction during the overlap. Also, I have observed that most of the time, the markets make a U-Turn during the overlap of the two sessions. It is during the overlap the markets make huge moves. This is why you should look to enter only during the LN Overlap.

Now, the timing is done. What about the entry criteria? Well, it is simple too. In an uptrend, go to 15 min TF, mark the nearest resistance level, wait for the market to break and retest it, then you are allowed to enter the trade. Keep your SL as wide as possible according to your 1% risk. The exit must be at 50% and 0% of the retracement and keep one more position open forever until you feel like closing it. 

&#x200B;

**So to conclude all of this, let's list down all of the steps:**

1. Remember **Rule 1: Buy the Dips in an Uptrend and Sell the Peaks in a Downtrend**
2. **Trend:** Every weekend, go through all the pairs and pick 5 of them that are in a strong up or downtrend.
3. **Retracement:** Wait for a retracement to the nearest TL or S/R plotted on 4H and Daily TF, stay patient, the most difficult part of trading. Plot only the supports in case of an uptrend and resistances in case of a downtrend. Look at the 50 EMA on the 1H chart and see if it the price is above or below it. In an uptrend, if the price is below the 50 EMA then only you are allowed to buy and vice-versa. Some people say that the price should be above the 50 EMA for buys, I disagree.
4. **Entry:** Enter only during the LN Overlap and only after the 15 min resistance has been broken and retested in case of an uptrend. Stay cautious during High Impact News or don't trade at all. Move SL to breakeven after 25 pips.
5. **Exit:** 1st Target must be 50% of the retracement and 2nd target would be the beginning of the retracement.
6. Stay confident and patient.

&#x200B;

**Lessons to Remember:**

* **Rule 1: Buy the Dips in an Uptrend and Sell the Peaks in a Downtrend**
* Don't enter when there is low volatility in the markets, as it might end up hitting your SL because of algorithmic trading robots. Enter only during the LN Overlap.
* Risk only 1% per trade.
* Keep your SL as wide as possible to give the market space to breathe.

&#x200B;

I am sure that you won't be able to stay patient for the markets to finish their retracement. Humans are impulsive in nature. They want it as soon as possible. The feeling of being in a trade is far more strong and satisfying as compared to losing money. This is why we don't stay disciplined and lose.

&#x200B;

You might ask, what is the win rate of this Trading System? I would say it is definitely more than 75%. The 25% is the case when the trend is about to change or if there is an SL hunt which is done mostly during high impact news.

I did do a search so I apologize if this has been answered before or belongs in another thread (I didn't see a megathread for newbie questions).

What I'm wondering is what happens during extreme events where your margin level drops well past the margin call and even beyond the stop out level (say you end up with a negative account balance). Are you on the hook for leveraged losses that can't close out? 

For example, let's say you are are trading in exotics and you have a long position in a pair that experiences a civil war and now their currency(ies) goes belly up and now you can't close out your position due to lack of liquidity or other reasons. Since you can't close out, can't cover the margin needed and your account goes broke what is the liability of the trader here? Could you end up in the deep end on the hook for millions of dollars in losses from a mini lot order gone bad?

However I have set up a demo-account through MetaTrader 4 and my demo account is through HugosWay. I know all the basics to trading for the most part, but not necessarily all the advanced stuff. Now I am not sure if it is just because I have a demo account that I am seeing so much profit (I know ""I'm supposed to be in the real market with a demo account) but I feel as though I did not need to learn most of the advanced stuff because it seems if I don't put a stop loss I will eventually see profit if I leave my trade open until there is a profit. I know there is the risk of losing A LOT of money if I do so. But there have been times where I experimented with it in my demo where I had lost hundreds of dollars but kept it open and in a week that flipped to me making a little less than a hundred.

In its bearish version any immediate support line break could bring the price between 1.205 - 1.20 (red arrow).

The prevailing trend continues to be upward as the price desperately seeks the MA 200 indicator and will continue to do so until there is no violation below the 1.205 support line (blue line).

The large traders are increasing their net shorts positions every week for some time but the price is keep increasing. What could be the reasons?

1. These large institutions are clueless and getting rekt week after week (I highly doubt it)
2. These large institutions are buying physical bitcoins and shorting the futures as a hedge. If that is the case then the price should skyrocket when they choose to close these shorts. Or alternatively, it can crash when they dump their physical bitcoins holdings in the market. That way they can make money both ways.
3. I am thinking too much and should take a break

You can’t change price on the chart between Ask/Bid/Mid. 

Does anyone know if these two factors can be altered on PRT?! In particular, on lower TF trades it’s obviously vital to be able to see the ask/bid rather than just mid, so I wouldn’t want to waste time adjusting to PRT’s layout if I can’t access those on charts. This is a two-second job on IG. 

On the plus-side, PRT is very efficient on CPU usage. Aside from the above issues, it has a pretty nifty scanner with dozens of parameters you can code yourself. 

Any general comments about PRT by those who prefer it would also be welcome.

4. If it’s within a day or two but it takes any more than that I get impatient and cut it short! I also tend to cut my winning trades short after a series of losses because “I want to take my profit now to recover some of my losses”. Bad mentality so I have to work on this

We can also see that a very clear propulsion zone is being created, indicating that every time the price touches or enters this zone it will be followed by a perfect bullish shot for very short trades.

I maintain my view that any break below $1810 (78% Fibonacci) would mark an irreconcilable reversal of the trend.

Today's recommended trade remains the same as it is on the chart and since we did the first analysis, only for today we won't wait for a bearish dive to start the trade.

As it has been its most recent behavior the price is still in a non-tradable zone, because between its immediate support and resistance lines are so narrow that they do not allow intraday operation.

Despite its recent behavior it seems that the price is putting some downward pressure on its immediate support line, this observation together with its price peaks with decreasing lows (blue parenthesis) leads us to think that there could be some momentary downward break below its support line (blue support line).

Even its broad-spectrum trend continues to be upward, but even a momentary breach of its 1,205 support line (blue line) would lead us to seriously reconsider this trend, as it would inevitably move it far away from the MA 200 indicator.

Personally I think the most sensible thing would be to open Sell Limit trade from 1.21 to 1.205 for an estimated gain of 500 points, at that point we open Trailing Stop and take advantage of all the downward movement that may arise.

 On the daily time frame there are multiple confirmations to tell me the market is going to be bullish in the coming weeks. We have seen a long term uptrend since June 2020. Up until now where we are faced with an area of consolidation since late July 2020 to present time (January) it almost seems as though a flag pattern has formed on the daily. My reasoning for this is drawing the Fib from the Previous Higher Low to the Previous Higher High, price failed to push past the 50% zone as well as dynamic support from the 200 EMA before retracing to the 38% zone and failing to push past since. Price also has the potential to get squeezed between the 50 & 200 EMA's and then breakout into upward movement.  


Overall; short term I believe we will see some [bearish](https://uk.tradingview.com/ideas/bearish/) movement before we see any kind of major [bullish](https://uk.tradingview.com/ideas/bullish/) movement, but as far as entries go I personally am going to wait until we test support levels again before entering any kind of long position.

Frankly I think it's ridiculous, I'm going to tell you why I think that, and this being the internet you can tell me where I am wrong. 
The kernel of truth here is that if you have some secret formula you don't want to give that to everyone. That makes sense because you worked your butt off for this skill and you don't want to give it to everyone. Does this mean that you will never teach anyone anything? Does this now mean you can't even impart the basics and some tips and things to avoid? Of course not. Successful traders could impart some portion of their skill quite easily.

So what would motivate a guru, educator, youtube personality? I can think of a few reasons form positive, to negative, and neutral.

**Negatives:**

Pure greed is top of this list. How much money do you want right now? How much would you be satisfied with right now? The dirty secret is that once you get there, it is extremely easy and common to move the goals. You suddenly want more, you have expensive tastes, or friends that you need to keep pace with. Google ""lifestyle creep"" if you want more info on that. 
Here’s another one that lies in all our hearts: ego. You want to be praised, you want to be told you are so smart, you want people following your every word. Especially common with youtube types and less with 45 year old finance nerds vanity publishing books with Wiley. 

**Positives:**

Let's say you have an amazing system but you have no capital. What's a person to do? Prop firm is one way, another is to sell a portion of your knowledge via books and videos to get cash. This could be a motivator.

How bout  this one, someone who changed their life and wants to help others do the same? What a concept huh? If you can’t imagine this person existing you are in a dark place my friend and I hope you can get out sometime. These people may be rare, but I will not say nonexistent. 

**Neutral:**

I have a family member who has a doctorate in psychology, and wrote a book on the psychology of retiring. One of the main points of that book is that people who think they are going to retire and just watch TV, play golf, and day drink are in for a bad time. Depression is very common in these types and they usually just wither away and die. Human beings need a mission, we crave challenges, and we need a reason to get up in the morning. If you are a wildly successful trader with no job to go to and you trade an hour a day, you really need a job or hobby. Producing forex videos and content is an option.

Last thought is that there really isn’t a secret to give away. I have listened to literally days of interviews with traders and there is a common theme that they talk about: the mechanics of trading is easy and the psychology and discipline is hard. That means the strategy we spend so much time worrying about is actually not that important. Go grab the damn trading rush macd strategy and only trade with that for a month. Maybe tweak it a bit and you will learn everything about it. I will bet that that strategy is good enough for you to retire in a few years. 

So how can you tell the motivations of some rando forex dude on the internet? You can’t. Some are downright frauds and some are just bored and trying to help. You can be super paranoid or you can buy your ticket and take your chances. But assuming no on successful will ever impart any wisdom is ridiculous.","self","https://redd.it/l28n4u"

A lot of people go hard, and overthink the fuck out of this. I respect that, but know what your zones actually mean, and put it in a current context. WHY is it happening, is much more important than WHAT is happening. 

Your fib lines are irrelevant to the globe. Nobody cares about your awesome DD. There is only fear, and greed, and they exist entirely outside of you.

I started trading mainly only the 3 main markets USD/EUR,JPY/EUR,AUD/USD. That is all I trade currently since I’m still very new and want little risk, I started with $100 in my account like ending October which was already tough in my opinion because of covid and election issues going on. I’ve taken some gains and losses clearly in the 3ish months I’ve been trading and I’ve made $120+ and am still in a $50 trade going up so about $260 is in my account currently, I also use my stops and limits. I’m not too familiar with trading day stocks or trailing yet though but I’m learning more and more daily! Curious if my profit is good or bad for how long I’ve been trading though since I only put $100 ever in my account (obviously smaller trades mean I can only trade not even 10k units yet so not the most profitable but I’m also not working with a lot of $$ I know) idk I just assume I should be making more or trading more days than I do/know more and not treat it like a gamble in a way?? I like to wait for high drops and go into a trade once it starts going back up following trading patterns of course but this is about all I’m educated in any advice at all is helpful!

There are great visualizations to help understand these concepts and put things in perspective.

For example, here's one on **expectation**. Expectation is the probability-weighted sum of all possible values in the random variable's support. 

Below, I've simulated 500 rolls of a fair 6-sided dice. We *know* the expectation is 3.5 (average of our uniformly distributed variable). In this particular simulation, notice the variance of our observations and how it finally starts to converge on the expected value after nearly 500 samples.

&#x200B;

Even though I understood the math, seeing this helped me remember the law of large numbers. Whether I'm on a winning streak or in a drawdown, it helps temper my emotions when it comes to trading. 

Not a single trade, or even 100 trades can really tell the whole picture.

Only when I break break even everything turns to poopoo.

I suspect my broker, but I suspect myself too.

Why is it that I could be 50% under break even and everything aligns its self and I'm able to reach break even but as soon as I'm over my break even, sht hits the fan on every trade with exact same confirmations ?

I could be in a trade for two weeks and dare it ever to give me more than 1.5% of my investment, no, only when I'm clawing my way back to break even 

Iv brought myself back from too many loosing streaks too many times with legit strats, tech analysis, fundamentals, help

Am I just stupid because it feels like I'm making my broker money if he took the exact trades I would if I were below my break even but screws me over as soon as I'm over my break even?

I researched my broker heavily to know they can't be shady? But none the less iv made withdrawals from them with excellent services, but get this the anomaly occurs when I place my next trade and almost exactly declines against me for the exact amount that iv withdrawn, this could be weeks later when the perfect setups happen or when ever, double tops, head and shoulders, engulfing candles, I'd have to claw my way back to break even.

 Hence why? am I missing something about something? 

I'm at the point that as soon as I break even with whatever profit I legit got to withdraw it immediately before it gets gobbled up by the market, iv spent 3years in this loop.","self","https://redd.it/l2vppp"

Im relatively new here (posting under 1 month, but lurked for abit and have been trading 4 years) but feel its time to move on. While I dont want this to be a rant post, the reasons are rant-worthy so I apologise if it comes across as such.

Over the month stay on the subreddit, it has become pretty clear that the posts that gain traction here are 1 off trades (most in hindsight), memes & posts about having a trading epiphany (most of which arent actually epiphanies).

While I have never said that I am a professional who should be listened to, it sucks when you try and contribute to the group (and I thank others who are on the same path) with issues that people encounter in actual trading that is more geared toward longevity in this industry & this is just overshadowed by someone logging on and posting about a supposed trade they took/ a meme.

Perhaps it's all my issue, maybe I misjudged what the purpose of the subreddit was to begin with.

Anyway, I don't intend to drag this on much longer. I will try to distance myself from the sub as it genuinely sucks to see so many on a path to failure being led by others who portray trading to be something it is not. I often have a feeling of anger when I see posts like the above because it undermines the hard work those that will eventually actually succeed are putting into it or the work that those who have found their success put into it and continue to put into it from day to day. These feelings of annoyance are the main reason I am stepping away as they wont go away because the root of the issue cannot be remedied : You cant help those who are busy chasing shiny objects and dont wish to be helped/ exposed to the reality of trading.

Thanks to anyone that made the stay enjoyable and I hope that the sub can see a mindset shift soon.

Im trading GJ and as you can see in the picture my predictions are for it to be bearish on monday.

Technical reasons:
1- Friday left a candle with a big shadow, in forms of candle readings I believe this wick to be filled (wick fill trading for the ones who want to understand better)
2- There is a strong resistance on 142.20 that has been rejected twice already for 2 weeks.
3- 4hr chart gave us a kinda doji star candle look alike.

Fundamental analysis ( I usually dont guide myself from fundamentals but is good to know this info)
1- Both countries are in bad economic shape (duh)
2- Japan is scare that new covid strain will cause the country lockdown to defliate their currency even more. (Japan is not obligated to do a full lockdown)
3- Brexit is showing problems in logistics with all rotten merchandise (fish) because there are issues with transportation logistics.

Making it short both countries are in deep trouble. My believe is that Monday will be bearish because of that candle. I will add a 5-10 pips trails stop loss at 141.80 and try to TP at 141.66 for profits. I believe this week will range a lot making it for easy money as long as 141.60 Support is respected. Will wait.

Also a Rising wedge is forming.  (bearish pattern for the ones who don't know)

Green arrow on chart is there if Support is respected. ( In hope for a breakout)","self","https://redd.it/l3efij"

What went well? This was a great entry, that was according to my plan and strategy that has been backtested. It is used in a flat(ish) market, and I wait for a candlestick pattern such as this reverse hammer, to enter. I try and target 3R but you may want to target the VWAP as well.

What could've gone better? Well, my discipline was lacking, and I exited early for only 1.89R on the hammer, 1 before my TP was hit. This wasn't in my plan, and honestly, I'm still working up my ability to judge if I should be conservative or if I should be agressive (like I should've here).

&#x200B;

Trade 2: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/5F5LxiYr/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5F5LxiYr/) 0R

What went well? Well my wave count was accurate I guess - thats it.

What could've gone better? 1. I entered on a wim, not in my plan, because I got shaken out with spread on my stop 2. As I talked about earlier, in this scenario, I wish I was more conservative, and got out at the support below (lime). My issue is this: Every lower low is a double bottom at some point, how was I supposed to know? Well, I am thinking maybe the hammer, but again, I'm still working on my ability in these sort of scenarios.

  
I'm wondering if this is of any value to anyone.

It's simply one of the most robust and beautifully designed pieces of software I've seen in awhile.*

&#x200B;

Recently, I've been using [Notion](https://www.notion.so) for task management, documentation, note taking, etc. across all my projects. It might be slightly geared towards a more technical crowd but I think it's quite intuitive. And as it turns out, it works very well for trade journaling. It's also free for personal use.

While spreadsheet software like  Excel/Google Sheets works ok, I wanted something where I can elaborate on a trade with pictures, notes, etc. Here's where Notion comes in.

**Tables**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yubvenijt6d61.png?width=2094&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad86427ef9b57872b176922dd568a718f189b18f

You can create tables that are pretty much like spreadsheets. Notion supports everything we need for our purposes such as formulas, tags, etc. 

**Pages**

The beauty is that each entry in the table is its own *page*. Each page has properties that we can choose to show or not show in the table view. For example, I have Entry/SL/TP prices but only show the RR calculations in the table view.

Then of course, you can add additional information to the contents like pictures or notes. You can also setup *templates* so that you can just fill out predefined sections or checklists when you add a new journal entry.

&#x200B;

[Properties of a page](https://preview.redd.it/se8vmjs1u6d61.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bad717d2a1b6f327f253f1799fda49e67b5426b)

&#x200B;

There you have it. I've just started transitioning to this as my journaling system so we'll see how it holds up.

To me it was always a shitty recommendation because that is obviously all that a lot of us can trade with.

As a beginner, I never understood why small accounts were bad to trade with, but now after almost 4 years of trading them and finally becoming profitable, I understand now that the danger is actually the mindset that comes with the fortune-from-nothing fantasy that is innate with small account trading. 

Small accounts can be dangerous for your long-term development of the skill of trading. Why? Because it puts your mentality on a slippery slope: you have to risk a higher ٪ of your account to make a meaningful amount of profit, which leads to more emotional trading, and emotions are a trader's worst enemy. Emotional trading is the quickest way to drain an account, and with small accounts and high leverage, it can happen way too easily. This is coming from experience of wiping, many, I mean many, small accounts ($50-$300 starting balance). And because this was all I did, emotional trading became my habitual style, and I gambled (and hard lost) for about 3 years straight before waking up and creating a much more disciplined approach.

Does this mean never trade with a small account? No, what is important here is the mentality in which you trade them. Do not be looking for some insane ROI, instead focus on trading your small account emotionless, only following your trading plan with forceful discipline. With a small account, your goal is to get good (consistent and emotionless) at Trading, not to make an insane fortune in a week. Have a pre-determined plan of entry, risk value, and exit and follow it to a T. 

My biggest tips for those who only have access to small acounts:

>Trade most frequently with a large demo acc, atleast 25k, and importantly, you need to treat it as if you were a pro trader. (Obviously its not real money, so adopting this mindset is a skill in itself). The demo gives you the ability to experiment and improve on your strategy, and also confidence when your strategy works. Take every trade as a lesson.

>Simultaneously, trade less frequently on your live small account, only when set-ups align exactly with the trading rules you have already outlined. Use a pre-defined risk and don't stray from it. Because it is smaller account, you have to risk more, thats just the nature of this style of high risk trading. Mine is 8%.

>Twin trade (put two trades down and split the risk) so that you do not cap your upside, but always keep your stop loss specific. Take a specific profit on one trade (mine is 4%) but let the other ride as long as possible (trailing stops or exit indicator). Note that twin trading is most effective for a trend-following strategy. 

TL DR;
You don't need to earn a fortune building a small account, and instead your focus should be perfecting your trading skill.
There are many a prop-firm looking for skilled Traders, you don't need the short-term money now. You need the long-term building of skill and discipline to follow an organized trading plan.","self","https://redd.it/l4444a"

On the 1D timeframe I marked the highs where the  previous uptrend finished.

On the 4H timeframe I determined the uptrend lines

On the 1H timeframe I was looking for an entry. I marked where the price failed to go up, which is a little over the 1H timeframe uptrend line that I drew. So when the price breaks this level I will enter and aim for the highs from the first picture.

I understand that if you have USD and expect EUR to appreciate, then you will sell USD in exchange for EUR.

However, the same course says:

>If you believe that the U.S. economy is strong and the euro will weaken against the U.S. dollar, you would execute a **SELL** EUR/USD order.

I don't understand. If you are holding USD and you believe the EUR will weaken against the USD, what benefit is there to selling the USD in exchange for EUR? If the EUR is losing value why invest in it?

Sup everyone. Hope you doing alright!

I'm Hiran (Brazil) and I've been studying price action for a few months.  
I have decided that I wanna share my everyday studies from the EURO/USD in order to build more confidence and knowledge through this methodology.

The main reason why I want to share this is that I don't know anyone else to talk and discuss forex. That's the reason I wanna hear your opinion about it! Let me know whatever I can improve for my next studies. Any ideas are welcome!! Thanks in Advanced.

Today I'm posting my studies from the monthly, daily and hourly chart and I'm always trying to figure both traders sides out. Bull and Bears.

Thank you very much!! Cya

Looking at GBPINR, I'm looking to move to India in the next few months and having looked at the GBPINR exchange, it seems as though the INR is getting weaker, or GBP is getting stronger (I'm not sure how to tell).

This time last year (2020) we were looking at GBPINR\~93 and it's now hovering at around GBPINR\~100. I still remember the days when we were getting GBPINR\~85 back in mid 2019!

Should I hold off on purchasing a large amount of INR right now (£10k+ so it does make a difference for me) or does it look like the GBPINR rate will get stronger in the coming months? How do prices even get determined?

I can see a descending triangle forming so could be looking for sells here. Waiting for a break of the support line to confirm this.  Could also form one last move to the upside before coming down, if support is rejected.

I found one online that’s like this: pips at risk * pip value * lots traded = amount at risk. I have a demo account of $10,455.97 and want to risk 2% which equates to $209.12. I use a 30 pip stop loss so $209.12/30 = $6.97 pip value. My take profit is 23 pips ( I know it may be dumb but I’m new and still trying things out. I used the 30 pip stop loss as extra cushion and will eventually reduce it). When I multiply 23 by the pip value $6.97 I get $160.31. So then I do the formula 30 * 6.97 * lots traded = 160.31 (209.12 wouldn’t make as amount at risk here because 30 * 6.97 = 209.12). After that I get lots traded = 160.31 / 209.12 = .766 so 30 * 6.97 * .77 (rounded) = $161 (close enough to $160.31) so my lot size would be .77. However I just took a trade right now with a lot size of .75 (by accident, was meant to be .77) and it went in my favor. I made a profit of $172.50 - minus the spread (6.36) which comes out to $166.14. Why is it that I made $172.50 and not $156.82? (23 * 6.97 * .75 = 156.82). I know my risk to reward is all messed up but I’m learning and that’s why I’m asking. Here’s the [link](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-determine-proper-position-size-when-forex-trading-1031023)  to where I got the formula.

How would you interpret these wicky candles?  


Two trains of thought:  


1. Lots of resistance, multiple failed attempts of going lower
2. Lots of tests of support, is being weakend, likely to fail soon  


I didn't take an entry according to my plan because I was unsure what these candles suggested, trying to avoid a stop out.

I am practicing on a demo account on MT4 on an Oanda server. I am replicating what it will be like to trade with my live account once it gets accepted by Oanda. The live account will have 200$ with a 1:10 leverage. Therefore, I opened a demo account with the EXACT SAME settings. 200$ account with 1:10 leverage. My question is, how am I able to open so many micro lots (0.01) with this small account equity and small leverage? I thought I would be only able to open 3 or 4 micro lots with this type of account? Please refer to the screenshot attached, I have at least 10 micro lots open and still am above 200% margin level. How is this possible? Am I an idiot and am missing something? Please help.

[Example \^](https://preview.redd.it/p3j9khbmr0e61.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=292b98e1c2972ee0054098e7aa3ff47aa537ed63)

Basically, it plays upon the volatility of the forex in the big up and down swings it has. 

Given a certain market price, I will set up a long and short as shown above (with stop loss and profit), the idea is that if the forex has changed this ""drastically"" from the market price, then it likely will continue in that direction for a bit more. Thus there is a window (the range between profit and entry) which I believe the currency will continue through to hit the profit rather than reversing.

It basically uses probability to give higher chances that my trades work out , meaning higher profit%, and thus a happier me.

(Or at least that's what I was thinking when I made it)

&#x200B;

Any thoughts, concerns? Again I'm a beginner just experimenting so go easy pls :P","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9NJjXV-YYMj_kn5LGb9p0OMi06Pij0M_r6Byjv1hX0Y.jpg","https://redd.it/l6qdjc"

I am a fairly new trader (started Jul 2020) and have been fairly profitable (2-3%/month) until the past 2 months where I got greedy and ignored my risk management. I blew my account and decided that I need to be strict and disciplined with my strategy so I went ahead for the T4T and FTMO funding challenges (they help you a risk management and being accountable also helps me stick to my plan). I just passed the T4T $50k funding and proceeded to trade live with their monies. (Also passed the first round for the FTMO, waiting for their 2nd round) which brings me to believe that my strategy works to a certain extent, the fact that it can bring me that far in the assessments.

I started the first day by following my usual strategy which is to determine market sentiment from most recent economic data release for pairs I trade (mostly US, so I based on the most recent fed interest rates things are going to go as is, ECB possibly looking to cut rates, etc.). I followed up with some simple S/R trendlines with MACD for potential entry with appropriate SL/TP. I ended the day losing $1k and I've been pretty stressed about losing 4x in a row. Which brings me to my question. How do you, experienced/funded traders, handle the pressure of losing many times in a row and still manage to keep your heads up high knowing that your strategy does work for you? Maybe you can share some insight and perspective with regards to this topic. I appreciate any advice, new strategies I can test, etc.

Feel free to ask for more info if it helps you answer the question better. Thank you!","self","https://redd.it/l6siuc"

1. Buy with the trend and set the TP to 5 pips with no stop loss. The problem with this strategy is the risk. It could be very profitable, but only if you are sure of the next 5 pips, which is hard.
2. Buy against the trend once the price reaches a turning point and if the price continues with the trend, buy again until it drops.
3. Same as number 2 but each time multiply by two to make a profit instead of just leveling out.

I know that these strategies seem odd, and they are. But I want to know if you have similar strategies that I could try out.

The liquidity that lies in the FOREX market allows for individuals to make a a few million without raising eyebrows because it is simply the transfer of money from one account to another and not a question of who will fund the liability of your appreciating positions. 

Put another way, Robinhood has to pay out the value of the stock at face value when they sell their positions, they are vulnerable to their solvency and the solvency of their liquidity providers.

Price cannot move in the FX market until liquidity is present first. Furthermore, on any given day the liability of FOREX.com is below -$15m. In other words, their traders' deposits are of x amount and they owe traders $15m less than that. So if you make a play for $350,000, you can easily see their liability can fluctuate without concern. Add to that that the amount to retail traders making this kind of money on a regular is a very miniscule amount, then you can fully understand why FOREX is SO LIQUID. Whereas, the Senate is going to hold a hearing about what is taking place in the stock market because people who make their wealth through financial innovation can get caught up. 

Short selling is an example of this. Besides fueling speculation and the benefits of the bubble that comes along with it, why even allow short selling of stocks? It isn't buying something that you perceive of value, it exists for the pure speculation of profit that can be generated through financial products. 

I can understand valuing a currency against another currency, expecting a currency's value to fall.

I don't understand betting against your currencies value over a stock, (buying stock, trading your dollars for stock)

Even worse short selling, valuing a currency over stock seems obvious. However, it obviously doesn't work out that way with the upward bias of equities. I understand debasing of the dollar against metals. Providing liquidity is what allows an economy to run. but what is the economic value in debasing your currency against equities? What is the value of equities to an economy besides profits in the financial sector which are gained through financial innovation, manipulation, and fraud? if companies need to raise capital why aren't corporate bonds more traded?

Once the market recognizes the dysfunction, the correction will be a strengthening of currencies against metals which should lead to the strengthening of currencies against equities (aka a broad global sell-off, a correction to find out the true value of equities).

I predict the equities market will fall to find its true price discovery, while corporate bonds will become the new financial revolution / innovation. 

All of this action will take place while metals are weakening as well trying to find true value and price discovery.

I believe we are watching the tip of the iceberg of these things taking place. I have no idea how fast it will happen, nor do I know if we will have a L shape or a v-shape at the bottom of equities, because chances are people will be willing to continue to rampant speculation as soon as some sort of bottom is made.

As much as I’ve been highly amused by the ‘David and Goliath’ nature of recent allegations of manipulation involving WSB and other stock/option groups, this doesn’t remotely concern me as a long-standing forex retailer. Not once in my entire life, for example, can I recall (as I said on WSB) a BBC finance journalist **laughing on air** while describing the GameStop saga during a live report on the BBC World Service- the busiest radio station on earth, listened to by a couple of hundred million people all over the world. It’s interesting, it’s definitely great entertainment, but it doesn’t worry me.

One of the absolute blessings of trading forex is **precisely** the fact that *retail forex traders have virtually zero impact on price*. I would go so far as to say that it’s the **Number One** reason I favour this market above all others. 

I invested in the stock market from about the age of 21 till I was 36, so let’s say roughly fifteen years. For the last six years of that I slowly started shifting more and more of my equity into forex until I had almost no stock positions left. Mostly medium-term holds for about 10% ROI per annum. Which was fine- I was young and just wanted stable growth. Plus I was doing fine working for Morgan’s and had no desire to complicate life. I still hold a small portfolio of positions on “the Four Horsemen” and other major bluechips and I’ve no intention of touching them- it’s risen in value quite nicely and has rode out the various dips. In that time I saw countless manipulations of stock prices, dozens upon dozens of short squeezes, along with ridiculous overvaluations and horrendous undervaluations. The whole thing became utterly tedious and I decided to drop it entirely. Not because I have any lack of faith in the long-term growth of the stock market but because I literally didn’t have time to juggle the damage being done to perfectly good companies by utterly external factors. It just got on my nerves. Far too many great firms also simply became slaves to the share price instead of concentrating on fundamental business structure. Same old story: Company X becomes the new Golden Child, a massive round of funding starts up, in come the suits, up goes the valuation. Then two years later Company X has become another stagnant, bored, fed up firm going nowhere now at the mercy of The Board and its controlling votes. 

The online retail share market has boomed since I first bought stocks 20 years ago, but I don’t have the patience to work through hundreds of reports again just to back a firm that is then nailed by some fund trying to make a quick profit through devious bullshit. 

Forex, meanwhile, has one long-term reality: the supply of, and demand for, a stable nation’s currency will be driven by factors that no bank or firm can fight without incurring tremendous risk and even larger losses. They might be able to inflict short- to medium-term damage or inflate a currency for a little daily profit, but in the long-haul a currency is worth what hundreds of millions or even billions of individual citizens say it’s worth. If shrewd central bank monetary policy in the EU creates conditions in which that economy experiences five years of growth there’s nothing a commercial or investment bank can do to stop it. And if they try, they’ll get crucified by governments whose entire national life depends on the value of their currency. 

In essence, the situation in forex is this: UK Plc has a board of directors: the UK government. It has 66 million main voting shareholders: its electorate. If the Board fucks up it faces removal at an election which will cost its directors both their jobs and their income and their reputation. Parties that screw up a currency have a tendency to be out in the wilderness for a very long time. So they take it seriously. Do governments get it wrong? Sometimes. Do they get it wrong on a regular basis? Absolutely not. 

In that equation, I don’t want retailers having a say any more than I want banks having a say. Just look at the average losses among retailers- upwards of 80% losing their money because they don’t have a clue how the global economy operates; incapable in most cases of spotting something as simple as a momentum shift, favouring quick trades with little rationale beyond short-term technical levels (perfectly legitimate and I do it all the time). But is that how I want the value of my entire economy to be managed? No. Do I want people like me controlling my currency’s value? No. 

The US financial markets are corrupt as hell, and anybody who wants to watch a riveting and absolutely shocking documentary about the corruption that links the Fed and White House and Wall Street **must** watch the documentary **Inside Job**. If you haven’t seen it then get it and watch it. Successive US administrations from *both* major US parties have not only failed to deal with the dire lack of rigorous protections but have actually made the situation worse. The 2008 crisis didn’t just cost people some cash, it wiped out millions of pensions and put millions of people on the streets and caused an unknown number of suicides which ripped the heart out of tens of thousands of families. How many high-ranking Wall Street directors were jailed? **None**. 

The power of Wall Street lobbies is now terrifying, but what does Washington continue to do? It gives jobs to people who should be in jail. This isn’t hyperbole; a lot of the individuals who’ve acted as cabinet advisers and technicians in the Fed should’ve been handed prison sentences but instead got immunity and government jobs. 

Forex is an imperfect market, but I’d rather speculate in a rational field than invest in companies which are flattened by hedge funds which don’t give a crap what happens to those companies as long as they earn 2% off of someone else’s misery. Do commercial banks piss about in the lower forex timeframes and take a nice slice of the action? Yes. I worked in one of the largest banks for long enough to know that what goes on behind closed doors among money market traders and analysts skirts the edge of legality on a regular basis. But can they do to the Pound or dollar or euro what hedge funds do to firms on a daily basis? No. 

Remember folks: “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent” (Keynes). Bank your small profits on forex and aim for long-term growth.","self","https://redd.it/l7dikx"

Some points may seem obvious, others not so, however what's important is the adoption of these tasks when trading forex. Over the many years in my forex trading career, i've learnt that being consistent with your daily tasks improves the consistency of your profits. So, the essential habits you must learn and adopt in your trading routine are:

#### 1. Self-analysis to determine if you are in a state of mind to trade

Prior to starting your trading day, it is very important to make sure you are in the correct state of mind to trade. You need to analyse yourself and make sure you are at the best state of mind to avoid mistakes in the markets.You cannot finish fighting with a friend, spouse, or colleague and expect to make great analytical decisions. Therefore the first and most important step is always making sure your mind is clear and at its best.

#### 2. Mental rehearsal to avoid mistakes

The second step involves you rehearsing your set of rules and making sure you are going to strictly stick by them. This will allow you to avoid many mistakes in the markets and in your day.

#### 3. Daily focus to lead you towards your goal

It is very important to have goals, but specifically daily goals. You need to determine what your goals are for the day including the pairs you are looking at, the times you will be trading, your risk management, and what you aim at gaining from the markets that day. Once goals are met, it is important to step back and wait until the next day to trade.

#### 4. Developing your own style of a low risk idea

For students of Opes Trading Group, low risk ideas and strategies are all taught to them during the forex trading course. It is important for every trader to develop their own ideas and strategies that are low risk in order to always protect their capital. Capital preservation is the most important rule of forex trading.

#### 5. Stalking the charts starting from high to low time frames

Looking at the charts from the higher to the lower time frames allows you to be able to see the bigger picture before looking right in. if you started looking from the lower time frames, you could have a wrong picture painted for you as to where the price could be heading. You cannot see the bigger picture if you are standing too close to something, it is the same concept on the charts.

#### 6. Action requiring commitment and not thought

Once a trade and an idea has been analysed, it is important not to second guess yourself and take the trade. Do not second guess yourself if you believe in yourself and your trades.

#### 7. Monitoring the trade to keep the risk low

Always keep your eyes on your trades. Now that doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be glued to your charts, but check them every once in a while, and at important candle closure, to make sure they are still playing out the way you expect them to.

#### 8. Aborting if the trade is not going well

If a trade does not go as planned (and the reality is some won’t), it is important to cut your losses if the trade is clearly not going to recover. There is no reason to hold on to a losing trade if there is no reason for it to recover.

#### 9. Taking profits when the reason for the trade has ended

A take profit is placed for a reason, however sometimes the reasons end before the take profit has been reached, meaning it is very important to close the trade even if it means closing it early. Never become attached to a trade that you chase the take profit only to find yourself back at 0, or worse, at a loss.

#### 10. A daily review to monitor and prevent future mistakes

At the end of every day, all the trades taken should be reviewed. This will allow you to see what you are doing right, and what you are doing wrong.This will give you a good indication for what is needed for future trades.

#### 11. Being grateful for what went well

Something so many people pay no attention to and ignore is gratefulness. Any positive day in the markets, is a great day! Be grateful for all that goes right, no matter how small the profits might be, because 90% of traders lost that day.

#### 12. A periodic review to make sure everything is still working well

Every quarter it is recommended that you review your whole trading system. As the markets change, we need to be able to change and adapt with them, therefore a periodic review will allow you to know if things that are working still are or aren’t.

So, there you have it. These 12 daily tasks have helped me immensely in creating a successful trading career, and if you can consistently practice these steps, it will be nothing but beneficial for you in every daily trade. To better comprehend the importance of these tasks, its a good idea to understand what forex is and to gain a better understanding of the trading environment.

My understanding is that IB will route my order, along with others, to the interbank pool. 10 to 100 lots is nothing for the interbank market, so, theoretically, 10 to 100 lots should be easily filled without slippage. 

I am trading based on a scalping strategy (each pip matters), so any major slippage will impact my risk management.

I’m relatively new the Foreign Exchange market game. I’m a 21 year old college student who made a promise to my self that I will never work another 9-5 again after college. I fully understand that this will take time but I’m mire than happy to put in the effort(due to the pandemic I’ve-got quite a bit of time.

I say all of this because I want to learn. A part from what seems like social media fueled MLM, and rich traders who likely amassed more of their wealth selling a course than actually trading I haven’t had much luck finding resources for learning and becoming an efficient/consistent trader, more specifically when it comes to real world application.

If anybody has any resources they can share it’d be great. 

*in no way am i trying to shortcut and use Fx as a get rich quick schemes like people try to sell on the internet. I want to learn. I want to understand it and be skillful at it.

Any experienced traders please add to this. 

Beginner Advice (in no order)
———————-
1. Do your own research, ask questions and back test back test back test.

2. Stay away from signal groups. They are everywhere! Ok, with a good group and proper risk management MAYBE you can turn a profit. But, you aren’t learning anything and you are at the mercy of the group. 

3. DEMO ACCOUNTS SAVE LIVES - the single most important piece of advice I give to everyone is to stay on your demo account until you feel ready... then stay until you feel confident... then stay until you have successfully placed over 250-500 trades with proper risk management and are still profitable.... then stay a little bit longer.

4. The moment you create your demo set some money to the side as investment. Then every week, or as you can afford it, continue to add to that amount. By the time you have built up the knowledge and experience on a demo account you can easily have a much bigger starting balance then you originally planned. 

5. Learn the basics. I see many new traders jump to candle stick patterns, different strategies or concepts, identifying chart patterns and just jump in trades like it’s a playground game. I am not necessarily against any of the above mentioned but just learn the basics and the lingo, and the overall general understanding of what’s going on before you venture to the next level.

6. Make a choice. Choose a bias (bear or bull) and choose 3-4 pairs to focus on. Now you have immediately removed thousands of options and “noise” that will confuse you and keep you running in circles. Example - if you are a bull (looking for buys) on two different major pairs then you are looking for a certain piece of information (whatever your confirmation is) on two different charts. If you don’t see it you don’t trade. This drastically increases your chances of success, decreases your risk, and will allow you to learn more about the currencies you are trading. Read that countries news, understand what’s going on in that area, back test the hell out of the chart. But now you have a few things to focus on rather than 2 million.

7. Slow down. There is no rush. Even if it takes you 5 years to become an experienced, consistently profitable trader that is a skill you will have for the rest of your life and will allow you to live life on your terms. Reeeellllaaaxxxx. Remember many people go to college for 4-5 years to end up where they started and sometimes in a worse position. Treat your education and trading like a job or school show up put in the work and you will be rewarded. 

8. Forex is for anyone but not always. Becoming a profitable trader will require work, dedication and determination (among many other things). Not everyone is willing to commit. Not everyone is willing to learn from their mistakes and do what’s needed to win. Don’t be that guy.

9. When you are doing everything wrong it is easy to say Forex is a scam. This is false. That program you paid $750 for may be a scam, that marketing pyramid you are a part of is surely not teaching you what you know, that telegram group that gives high risk signals on US30 is probably not the best teacher. The word scan should never be mentioned with forex. 

10. Find a group, like this one here at r/Forex ... find some friends... message people and learn from those that genuinely want to help.

Most importantly above all else - hold yourself accountable for your wins, loses and draws. After all you are the one doing or not doing the work. 

Looking forward to what is added to this and any questions or comments!","self","https://redd.it/l7t261"

Basically, I had a stop set at the horizontal grey line in the image, 126.543, which would have resulted in a -£3.60(ish) loss. This was well within my risk tolerance per trade, but when 212 notified me that the SL had been hit, despite price clearly never reaching anywhere near the SL, I was confused. On top of this, as you can see in the image, the size of the loss roughly doubled, to -£7.78, which would make the actual position of the SL well above the price stated.

I just wanted to know if anyone else had had a similar experience with Trading 212? 

(normally this type of thing can happen at 10pm GMT so I remove the SL for an hour and replace it at 11pm GMT, this obviously wasn't at that time.","self","https://redd.it/l7xb1n"

How do I boost my confidence on the live trading charts again I have opened up a 100$ account and plan to trade for the next 2 monthish.

(WARNING Long read) Background of myself and my career trading.


I used to be the bystander just watching ppl make money and I dreamed of it and dreamed and never did anything till last year and I still feel like I don’t do shit so. I started off as an investor last year around this time I bought tsla and just had reddit and I made 2k overnight... 2K!! That’s life changing to me and then I did what every noob does and made 10k in one day during work.... I was so like crazed and anxious this was life changing to me I thought I could quit my job(didn’t till just last month) but after that I wanted to learn I followed Wall Street bets for few months made money and blew quite a bit almost all from no risk management or any edge I have learned now and after a few months. I learned trends break out patterns emas and bla bla bla I was day trading the stock market with stop loss and exits using emas and I did alright but it was still difficult for me Bc I fomod and lost quite a bit of money and I was scared I hated how everything could change from a moment like tweets the news ect ect so I found a friend through reddit and he helped me into forex he didn’t teach me but I went and learned and seen it was more technical and mindset based and mindset was what I needed. So I learned the forex way I watched Daniel savage course good course and I took a ftmo practice challenge and traded 5k in demo money and turned it into 6.5k in a month and well first the demo then the challenge and I pasted I was like wow risk management is INSANE! And yeah I took the challenge and FAILED haha also it was cause I learned well switched to institutional trading due to high rr compared to 1:3r ratio but yeah and then I lost confidence after that I was backtestinf I was profitable and still am and I’m still scared of the markets idk if it’s scared or nervous. But yeah now I’m sticking with the institutional strategy backtesting still profitable but I’m inplementing the methodology of supply and demand due to it being the same concepts order blocks and supply and demand.
So question how do I get myself out of this? I’m 21 by the way I’ve been reading books like atomic habit eat that frog started working out to get my mindset right Bc I learned MINDSET is huge in this it’s not about winning it’s about mindset knowing that no matter what you lose at the end of a month or year or months you are profitable! Even on losing streaks! It sucks but I watched the mark guy interview it’s ALL PROBABILITYS So any full time fx traders I would love to talk to you!","self","https://redd.it/l84l2y"

I'm new to forex trading but I have a bit of experience with the stock market, I'm joining Forex because the comissions in the other market are extremely high.

I had a few questions about income and profitability, you see, in the stock market we can have 20 and even 30% moves in a single day, which gives us a lot of space to execute our trades and make a good daily income.

In my time in the stock market I always set myself a goal to make between 1 and 2% of my investment without using leverage before retiring for the day. I'm currently playing on a DEMO account of OANDA and I'm really struggling to hit 0.5% of my investment.

But I have also seen YouTube videos of people entering and exiting trades in a few minutes or hours and making 3-7% of what they invested.

I guess my question if how to maximize profit in order to hit consistently 1% and in some cases 2-3% of my investment daily.

What advice can you give me (a new forex trader) to be more profitable in this market?","self","https://redd.it/l8cf36"

Are there people who follow the above statement in their trading, but do NOT use indicators for their TA? What is your strategy like? How do you determine entry and exit?

I understand that naked traders wait for a candlestick pattern (reversal/continuation) to print at a zone (support/resistance) in order to enter their trades, but there would be times when the market would not be at a zone when the news comes out. So if you are using the Wallstreet statement, what do you do in those times?

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND START LEARNING HOW TO TRADE! Here’s how you get scammed: 

Multiple TPS - they will send out multiple tps, but the stop loss is way bigger than the tp. For example (30pip stop loss and then first TP would be 10pips and move stops to B/E) if they get stopped out they will count it as a win even tho it didn’t reach the full target.

PIP COUNT measurement. It ties with the first point listed above. Sure they might have gotten 10pips,but not with the full position. So essentially they only closed 50% of position but they counted it as profit. In a case of a losing streak the pip count may be a lot but the money isn’t earned.

Incredibly large stop losses. I’ve seen one signal where the stop loss was literally 150 pips and the first tp was 12 pips away, so of course it will seem like their hit rate is insane.

Editing telegram messages- they will edit signals if it hits SL to make it seem like it wasn’t a loss

There are no shortcuts to learning how to trade. Backtest your strategy, journal, and be confident in your execution.","self","https://redd.it/l8gs6b"

If with a capital of £1000 you entered at a price of 1.10366 and set your stop loss at 1.09523 which would be a loss of £61.97 ( roughly 6.2% ). And if you set your take profit at 1.17401 which was a resistance point that was tested roughly 6 times by weekly candlesticks ( a decent resistance point ) you would of made £509.86. Now this total trade from entry to take profit would have took roughly 43 days. So to summarise you would of risked 6.197% of your capital, and would of had a return of 50.986%. 

Would you regard that as a strategy you would use. 43 days is a good waiting time. And would require patience. But that's just from looking at previous strong resistance and support points. 

I think if one was to engage in a trade like that there would need to be a few other forms of indicators or strategies to solidify that going long position. 

So with that being said let's hear your thoughts and also in that event , what indicators or strategy would you be using at the point of break above the resistance, to solidify your thoughts that this market is moving in an uptrend.","self","https://redd.it/l8jdxt"

In almost any forex trading community/course etc, they'll be sure to teach you about how you can try to keep your emotions in control. This is 80% of the time only related to just holding a losing position or suffering a losing streak. 


The truth is, holding a losing position only becomes psychologically challenging if you're not following the right risk management or trading plan. And/Or, you don't even have a plan in place. If you did, you would know the reason your trade hit a stop loss - mostly you'll know before your stop is hit that the trade has been invalidated.


##Trading Psychology When In A Profitable Bubble

_Take note I said ""bubble"" because I would assume if you have this issue - you must be struggling to stay in that bubble long enough to assume that you're profitable_


Notice a pattern of a certain psychological behaviour when you have money? I'm talking money you can't even believe you have. 

You have a ""_high_"" kind of feeling. It's like everything is just right in the universe. 


This is because money triggers a certain hormone in our pituitary gland. (_I won't dive into the biological terms etc, this isn't my expertise. You can search through the internet_). The important part is that hormone is almost like you took a drug of just perpetual happiness. 


Back to forex trading. Now when you trade forex and you've reached the ""aha!"" moment stage. You've found a working strategy, plan etc and you're in that **bubble**. You are making money, consistently over a couple of days or weeks. You compound your account and make even more money. You become __euphoric__! 


This is a very thin line between the reality and a dream because you're seeing money you haven't before. To some people, this happens early on in their career and they come here boasting about how come we struggle to make money in forex but we never see them two months down. 

Now that you are making money, you start feeling invincible because like I mentioned - this feeling is like a dream/drug. You're ecstatic. Where does risk management and trading the plan go? Out of the window! You have figured out the market, rules don't apply to you anymore. This is a beginning of a huge and ugly spiral down to losses and possibly depression. 



In my honest opinion, managing your emotions when you have found a working strategy and somewhat know what you are doing might be the most important part of moving forward from that ""break even phase"". This is something that will allow you to be disciplined even when you see an okay setup, you'll know that you're only going to trade a setup that fits your rules only nothing else. 


Managing your emotions when making money leads to avoiding silly mistakes. When you're a successful trader, making enough for your family to stay in a comfortable environment - you'll realise that it's not one trade that has to pay for your monthly mortgage, it's a series of them. Also you realise that what's important is remembering that the profit isn't yours until it's realised. 


This brings me to the last part of this. __Profit Taking__

You should always have really realistic profit targets. I mean very realistic. Yes 500 pips sound damn good, but a series of 10 trades that hit 50 pip profit targets are just as good. Sometimes you get a good home run sure but it can't happen the whole time. You just can't allow yourself to hold a trade until it goes back to a negative when you could have been happy with your gains and moved on. 

I think the reason this ends up looking like a job is because we want to force money out of the market. A good in and out of trades (_2 days max_) while you're still building an account are really rewarding long term. 

You can decide to go full position trading on stocks if you love the feeling. At least there you have some sort of guarantee that the S&P will keep rising after every dip. 


__The idea__ is to once we get it right, we exploit it as best as we possibly can. But we can't do that if we marry our analysis and not get out of a trade when it has clearly matured so we can move on to new opportunities. __Or__ get big headed and abandon our rules. 


_This isn't financial advice, please don't follow this blindly. I meant to copy and paste some old notes from an old source, David Paul but my wife cleared up old boxes so I hope this is close enough_

1. Being greedy may lead to bad and fast decisions. If your trade is huge compare to your account or income, you are gonna lose control of your emotions.
2. Be like a bot that sells and buys according to strategy and not emotions. If you say that you will sell when it reaches 1 2 3 then do that even if the losses maybe a bit greater.
3. Discipline is everything. If you follow a strategy your results will be the results of the strategy rather than your emotions.

And last but not least, sometimes not trading is trading. This means you don't have to be in the market every time there is a small chance for success. Just trade when you are most certainly sure.

So I'm new to forex trading and I've just come up with this strategy. But before I spend time backtesting I want to make sure the strategy isn't completely idiotic. (I have made a trading plan which details everything else - if needed I can provide this).

So here's the basic rundown of my strategy and a picture of an entry (I've also attached an image below).

Timeframes traded: Daily and 4 hour

1. First I plot major support/resistance levels on the monthly and weekly timeframes and plot these. I will use these timeframes to grasp the overall longer-term trend.
2. I will see if there are any support/resistance levels on the daily or 4 hour timeframe which have been confirmed. (confirmation = price tested the level twice)
3. I will wait patiently for price to approach this level and wait for a reversal candlestick pattern such as an engulfing bar.
4. Price has to also bounce off (or come quite close to) the bottom/upper Bollinger Band.
5. If going long stochastics need to be in oversold levels and vice versa for going short

If someone could check over this just to make sure the strategy isn't ""too simple"" or ""needs another indicator"" I'd really appreciate this!

The German economy saw a moderate rise in growth for the fourth quarter, gaining 0.1% for the three months ending December. The rise still highlights that Europe’s largest economy is still some way off its pre-pandemic pace of growth. Some optimism can be taken from the fact that growth remained despite another implementation of movement restrictions at the end of the year. The year 2021 has also started well for Germany, with 41,000 workers moving out of unemployment in January. This is considerably more than the 6,000 that was forecast for the period. Labour market statistics from the UK highlighted how difficult a year it was for British workers. Since the start of the pandemic, 828,000 workers left the labour market with peak redundancies taking place in September. 

Demand for ‘Made in the U.S.A’ goods appear to be healthy. Core Durable Goods orders rose for the eighth consecutive month to 0.7% in December. A more tempered rate of economic growth was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020, which saw a 4% rise in output, compared with a 33.5% rebound in the third quarter. Output is now estimated to be only 2.5% off the rate of growth seen before the Covid-19 outbreak. The labour market also looks to be showing improvement with 847,000 jobless claims for the week ending 24th January; 33,000 less than forecast. Unsurprisingly, there were no changes to monetary policy from the Federal Reserve at the January committee meeting. 

Growth in China remains steady according to PMI surveys although the pace of output has slowed in anticipation of the Chinese New Year holidays. Both manufacturing and services surveys reached 51.3% and 52.4% respectively. Exports remain healthy and domestic demand has picked up, with the construction sector leading the rise in output. Economic recovery in Japan appears to be slowing, as industrial output in December registered another month contraction. Preliminary figures show the sector declining by 1.6% as continuous lockdown measures continue to stymie the recovery for the world’s third largest economy.","self","https://redd.it/l9tn3f"

(actually as in many markets, 2-4 Feb will start daily trends in many markets for nearest 1-2 weeks atleast)

Take a look, we were climbing tightly for few months and finally broke under Gann Angle, we only need a Time to elapse and this is 1-3 feb.

I was doing mean reversion multi-timeframe strategy with almost 80-90% win rate. This continued until few months and my account more than doubled but then I became cocky and blew up my whole account including my intial capital. Although I was keeping my leverage to the minimum but  I was targeting less profits with very wide stoploss or no stoploss at all. Since that day I promised I will never go against TREND and will always trade with a reasonable stoploss. Luckily I held some btc & eth in cold wallet which I am selling in stages. Anyway then I moved to commodity (mainly USOIL and XAU) last year in May after OIL crash, doubled my account 2nd day but then slowly slowly my account went down by 85% not because there was a flaw with my strategy but because of my poor risk and money management. In my defence my account size was too small to manage risk properly with futures market and so I decided to give futures trading a pause until my account size is big enough to take proper risk management. However my encounter with commodity made me realize how important risk/money management are. I also realized not to trade below daily chart as the main price movements on commodities were happening when I was sleeping. 

Then I entered Forex with some rules and so far I am in profit and learning new things everyday:

1. Trade with the trend.
2. Trade daily chart 
3. Higher timeframe rules. Check higher timeframe (weekly) for double confirmation so that you don't go long on daily when weekly is bearish.
4. Maximum stoploss (1% or 2% of the account) must be defined and lot size has to be calculated accordingly. 
5. Look for the reason not to enter a trade. You don't have to trade everytime and nobody is pushing you. Enter the trade only if you are highly convinced.
6. Do not change your backtested strategy again and again and give it some time because there will be times when you will have doubts in your strategy. 

So in nutshell, like many have said - first is psychology, second is risk management and the last is technicals/fundamentals. If you have good psychology and proper risk management, you will make money in the long term even if your strategy is so so. But if you have an excellent strategy; with poor psychology and risk management then your account will go to zero one day.

Last I would go out of the way and tell not to put substantial capital even after seeing good results with demo account. Start with small capital because most likely it will also go to zero due to the real emotions kicking in.  That way you will learn from your mistakes and take it as an educational costs. I believe the best way to learn is to learn by failing. You can go to heaven only after dying. So instead of taking paid courses from internet gurus, invest in yourself by doing live trading as much as possible with that money before pouring some serious money.

I wish all of you all the best with your trading.","self","https://redd.it/lamw7a"

My broker is Pepperstone. I placed an order with a 10 pip stop loss, and used their advanced protection system which allows me to have two profit targets and the option to automatically move the stop loss to break-even once the first profit target is hit. I do this for most of my trades and it always executes correctly. 
So this particular trade hits the first profit target, and my stop loss is automatically moved to break even. This is done while I'm away from my station. I come back to my station an hour later and my stop loss is completely GONE. This was on the AUDCAD pair just after the big drop at 3:30 and I had to manually close the position after most of the damage was done, and I made a loss of 24 pips when I should've made a profit. 
I looked up all the transaction info on my platform and everything looked fine, I didn't make any mistake or remove the stop loss, Pepperstone removed my stop loss when the first target was hit while I was away from my station. 
Can someone please give me an idea of wtf happened? I looked this issue everywhere and I see very little similar experiences, and Pepperstone support will not give me an answer for 3 days. I have positions open right now and as I'm not at my computer all day I now have no peace of mind that my SLs will get removed from all of my positions again for no reason.

Recently I have been looking at the charts differently. Now, I look for higher highs and lower lows. This perspective made my decisions much better and it made the chart clearer for me to predict.

I trade using technical analysis. I use the AC and AO indicators to determine overbought and oversold areas. If the AC turns green, and the AO below the zero-line this means that the currency will probably make a higher low. But that's not it, if the price drops, then it's forming a lower low.

I just wanted to share this with you all because it has helped me a lot.

Just by changing the way you look at the market could make your decisions better.","self","https://redd.it/lb0wrm"

This is where we need **discipline** and **patience** as timing of the entry is very important otherwise the price will go with the trend but without us. Here is my experience:

1. We **must** ascertain first which timeframe we want to trade like 30m, 1hr, 4hr, daily. Now the  correct timeframe is different from person to person as it depends on everyone's trading style, strategy, work schedule, capital deployed, timezone etc.
2. We should respect higher time frame and try not to go against it. For example if we are trading 1hr/4hr then try not to go against daily and if we are trading daily then try not to go against weekly.
3. We **must** seek to catch the dips in uptreand and sell the peaks in downtrend in our ascertained timeframe.

Now following everything by the book does not guarantee a win as it is all a game of probabilities so next comes risk management. We **must** know maximum how much we can lose if the price hits our stoploss. Experts says it should be only around 1% to 2% or maximum 5% of our capital depending on our experience. Think like running a business and consider it as a cost and not as a loss.

Next is money management. Before taking the entry, we **must** know how and where to exit, whether it be a fixed RtoR or trailing stop or whatever but we must plan it in advance because once we get in the trade then GREED and FEAR will takeover our mind at some point and we will not be able to think clearly where and how to exit.  

Disclaimer: I am not a Pro-trader and have experience of only around 3 years of trading. I suck at being disciplined and patient hence I keep reminding myself above things daily to train my psychology so that I do not deviate from my own plan.","self","https://redd.it/lbf24w"

Traded forex now for a few months. Options traders for a few years now. 

Have a habit of being able to run small accounts up 1-500% of all small dollar amounts up to about $300

I do much better with $100 though then a bigger account probably because of what I’m explaining is horrible for proper money management.


I’ve done $75 to $500 

More recent burned down $550 to $90 then to $450 then to $200 then to $800 (I withdrawal $650)

I do this in a matter of 1-3 hours generally 

I trade mostly etherum, us30 when my account is $250, and occasionally nasdaq and spx

I like bitcoin but I have learned ether gives me tighter spreads so I moved away from bitcoin because it was burning me to much with the $1-3k drops

So my question is this a thing? I don’t think I’m unique at all, I think it’s wonderful I can create so much profit so fast but not so much that I burn accounts so often. 

I have money problems right now so I think this is influencing my style of trading as I know that I’m basically gambling. 

I’m telling my self that my style of trading is ok I just need to perfect it. I actually see why I burn my accounts by taking high leveraged positions at bad market timing. For me that is a psychology thing. Something I feel I can master.

I’m not oppose to a more structured style of trading and feel I am very capable of it, it’s just not really my thing right now because I see I can be profitable the way I trade just need to master my mindset.","self","https://redd.it/lbhhua"

Below is my full trading plan.","OTHER/META",0.95,24,0,0,16,0," This is a trading plan based on years of experience. Trial, error, gains made, money lost, shock and realization that anything can happen in this market. Understanding when I am in sync and understanding when I have no pulse on the market. Some may call it an art, others an instinct, I just call it being true to myself. I can’t explain every detail to participants as that would be relative to explaining quantum physics to a three year old, or me for that matter as I know nothing of quantum physics. I pride myself on Knowing that I don’t even know what I don’t know. This is my plan, and I do call it my plan because you cannot see what I see, think what I think, act as I act, nor could I do those things as you. I offer it to participants for two reasons; First, the universal law of attraction: whatever you release, speak, and think, the universe will create a unique vibration, positive or negative and that vibration will return to us in kind. I have had for over a decade above all a desire to be a full time Forex Trader. If I can help enough other people reach their goal through trading then maybe I too can reach mine. Second, to help others overcome what I have discovered, that is the solitude of this profession. I am not just speaking of the hours of screen time all alone, looking at charts with nobody to bounce ideas off. But also the end of the day or end of the trade where your best friend, spouse, significant other, children; have zero idea what you are talking about. For those reasons I share with you my trading guide.  
***Fibonacci*** **Pivot Strategy**  
The *Fibonacci* pivot Strategy is trading strategy that combines the use of both the popular *Fibonacci* sequence and pivot point to trade forex. They are decisive points on charts where the price action may witness strong support or resistance and indicate a market reversal or if knocked out of order it can signify strong moves.  
I combine it with a secondary set of support and resistance indicators called Murrey Math based on Gann Principles. WD Gann, was a finance trader who developed several technical analysis methods. Gann market forecasting methods are based on geometry, astronomy and astrology, and ancient mathematics. Don’t stress, as long as your indicators are right you don’t need to understand the entire education behind it, just as a baker doesn’t need to understand microbiology to make bread or a brewer to make beer (which I do know something about).  
Finally I add in fundamental analysis into my strategy to have a true big picture of what markets are likely to do.  
**Murrey Math** is a complex set of support and resistance levels that act more or less the same as pivot points but also they provide some insights whether the current trend should continue or it should reverse.  
**Fundamental analysis** is a way of looking at the forex market by analyzing economic, social, and political forces that may affect the supply and demand of an asset.  
**How to trade Fibonacci Pivots**  
**Fibonacci Pivot Strategy & Price Action Trading**  
Price action occurs as a result of the operation of the top players in the financial market like the central banks and commercial banks together with the very large speculators. These top players in the financial marketing rely on levels. The key players in the financial markets may use different strategies, indicators, fundamental analysis and much more, but at the start of the day to day trading or the trading period theyconcentrate on, they basically watch out for one particular thing on their chart which is the price levels. They watch the levels at which they have firm price that is likely to react, and levels at which they have decided to enter or exit the market. The top players in the market concentrate mainly on authentic **price levels,** instead of on the indicators or financial systems. A more detailed description of these levels:  


**Periodic Highs and Lows**  
This indicates the highs and lows attained in the preceding period. For instance, you may plot the preceding week’s highest and lowest price point attained, looking forward to a reaction at these farthest levels.  
**Support and Resistance Levels**  
This can be planned in the future, depending on where price previously establish either support or resistance with candle formations for confirmation.  
**Round Numbers**  
These means larger price levels culminating in zero, for instance 1.5150 and so on. Very influential levels at which to anticipate a reaction, and once more, we can plan them across FUTURE price levels, contrary to a few form of lagging indicator.  
**Pivot Points**  
The pivots are not commonly utilized by retail traders and this is a tragedy. It is very beneficial if you know how to use them especially for the higher timeframe. Pivot points help to divide the present period into levels based on the preceding period’s price extremes. It is related to Periodic Highs and Lows, but plots the different intermediary points where price can be anticipated to react.  


**I am not trying to lose you here, just make you understand there are depths to price action. Follow these guidelines to start.**  
Zones 61-100 are often areas where swings fail and you can counter trade or trade with the trend. Pivot trading works in either direction, I suggest for beginners to determine the trend based on a minimum of a daily chart, and trade in the direction of the trend. There are other advanced methods of choosing direction based on swap costs etc… but that is not for today.  
Weekly Pivots are equilibrium, creating for me a road map of support and resistance. The best trades are at S/R 61-100 levels, however trades can be made above or below WP, again with experience. I like to enter the market with stop and limit orders but I will enter market orders if timing and price action are right.  
The market rarely moves strait up or strait down and so this strategy works a majority of the time. A kin to driving down a road and following the signs, however the market frequently decides to divert from the path and we need a larger view to see where those areas might be, since we are entering in the opposite direction of a break out. Draw down will happen with this strategy but with Murrey Math levels we may be able to mitigate some.  


**Murrey Math** is a complex set of support and resistance levels that act more or less the same as pivot points but also they provide some insights whether the current trend should continue or it should reverse. I consult these areas of support and resistance to confirm a trade or determine if a break out has actually occurred and if so where the next area of support and resistance may be. Below are a quick and dirty set of guidelines I use.  
**Murrey Math Guidelines**  
**8/8 th's and 0/8 th's Lines (Ultimate Resistance)**  
These lines are the hardest to penetrate on the way up, and give the greatest support on the way down. (Prices may never make it thru these lines).  
**7/8 th's Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse)**  
This line is weak. If prices run up too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse down fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move up to the 8/8 th's line.  
**6/8 th's and 2/8 th's Lines (Pivot, Reverse)**  
These two lines are second only to the 4/8 th's line in their ability to force prices to reverse. This is true whether prices are moving up or down.  
**5/8 th's Line (Top of Trading Range)**  
The prices of all entities will spend 40% of the time moving between the 5/8 th's and 3/8 th's lines. If prices move above the 5/8 th's line and stay above it for 10 to 12 days, the entity is said to be selling at a premium to what one wants to pay for it and prices will tend to stay above this line in the ""premium area"". If, however, prices fall below the 5/8 th's line then they will tend to fall further looking for support at a lower level.  
**4/8 th's Line (Major Support/Resistance)**  
This line provides the greatest amount of support and resistance. This line has the greatest support when prices are above it and the greatest resistance when prices are below it. This price level is the best level to sell and buy against.  
**3/8 th's Line (Bottom of Trading Range)**  
If prices are below this line and moving upwards, this line is difficult to penetrate. If prices penetrate above this line and stay above this line for 10 to 12 days then prices will stay above this line and spend 40% of the time moving between this line and the 5/8 th's line.  
**1/8 th Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse)**  
This line is weak. If prices run down too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse up fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move down to the 0/8 th's line.  
The ***Fibonacci*** pivot Strategy is trading strategy that combines the use of both the popular ***Fibonacci*** sequence and pivot point to trade forex. They are decisive points on charts where the price action may witness strong support or resistance and indicate a market reversal or if knocked out of order it can signify strong moves.  
**Fundamental Analysis**  
Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the forex market by analyzing economic, social, and political forces that may affect the supply and demand of an asset. It’s Economics 101, it is supply and demand that determines price, or in our case, the currency exchange rate. The hard part is analyzing all of the factors that affect supply and demand. You have to understand the reasons of why and how certain events like an increase in the unemployment rate affects a country’s economy and monetary policy which ultimately, affects the level of demand for its currency. The idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country’s current or future economic outlook is good, their currency should strengthen. Fundamental analysis combined with pivots can give us a strong edge on the direction a pair will move.  
**Psychology of Trading**  
Everything I have talked about so far is minutia; it can be learned on a demo account over time with guidance and online resources. Please, if you are new to this UNDERSTAND this, Psychology of trading, discipline, thinking with a clear head when your account is up, and staying calm when your account is down, when to react to surprises and when to sit on your hands, it CANNOT be taught. I repeat IT CANNOT BE TAUGHT only learned. It’s typically several expensive lessons, and you will pay for the education. It’s also a lesson that never ends, you can be a master at this and still have your head dig you a hole that was unnecessary to dig. Read all the books you can dig up, watch all the videos you can find, they will help, but you will only truly learn through experience at this. Good luck and god speed, may the force be with you, and may the wind be always at your back and the sun upon your face. This is the single most important realm of trading.  
**Money Management**  
This is the second most important realm of trading. Also not something I am going to dive into too deep because this is also highly personal. I use only catastrophic stop losses if I set them at all. I have a number in my head based on my account balance and that is the place that I will take a loss if support and resistance, fundamentals and price action says so. What I won’t do is enter a trade 10X to be stopped out after a 20pip hiccup 10X only to have my target hit several hours later. That is not how the market guides me. I will tell you it takes a might of psychological fortitude to do what I do the way I do it. I will give you this guideline, if you are going to trade this path, be prepared to give a 80-100pip stop loss and manage your position size accordingly. I enter the market in areas, which means not all at once. Small portions of my maximum position size at different prices in my area of interest.  
Example: Max Position= 1 Lot.  
.10X10 scattered over an area of Support or Resistance= 1 lot. First entry and last entry could be 30-50pips apart.  
I should also cover risk reward ratio here. Many will shake their heads at me. I am willing to risk 10% of my account on one trade IF necessary, meaning if fundamentals, price action and pivots indicate a hold. My reward is as much as the market will give, which is based on pivots, fundamentals and price action. Entries and targets are both determined in the same way; Areas of Support and Resistance, Fundamentals and Price Action.  
**GOALS**  
What I can recommend here: Do not set daily goals, it creates too much pressure. My goal is 10% of my original account balance per month until my account balance grows to 100%. Then I withdraw a quarter of my account balance. The 75% return is now my account balance and becomes my new base for monthly 10% growth goal.     *""Not all those who wander are lost."" - Tolken*","self","https://redd.it/lbnrp1"

However, it just seems to0 good to be true.  I have found a method that works for me, a pair that the method works on, and consistently traded it over the last 6 months to a profit of around 11% over 38 trades. (rather than a practice account I started trading at 1% of £500 and increased from there, keeps me more engaged than pretend money and provokes more emotions to help practice dealing with that)

Assuming results continue as they have so far, thats 22% a year, which with compounding interest is starting to look like an early retirement. Part of me is starting to consider trading a higher sum of money, and part of me thinks I should be reserved and continue for a year at the scale I am now. The latter part of me is doubting and saying 'maybe this is just a fluke' , and the other part of me is saying 'move onto the next phase and up the money a bit, see how you deal with the emotions'.

Its hard to judge if I'm being too reserved and should just move forward and up the stakes a bit, or if I am in fact acting rationally when thinking of holding to what im currently doing for a full year. I mean what is a 'year' in terms of trading right, it's a probability game and the number of trades is what really matters in allowing the probabilities to play out.

So I guess my question is does it seem too early to be thinking it might work; is 38 trades enough? And, what level of proof/practice did you have to demonstrate to yourself before finally making a transition from trial and practice to what you then considered real trading, with a comparably significant sum of money?","self","https://redd.it/lbrmk1"

What is not talked about a lot on this reddit is Diversification of your portfolio.

I suppose many may just not consider it or do it subconsciously, however proper diversity in your trading plan is another vital step of Risk Management as well as Min/Maxing your losses and profits.

I fear many new traders never consider this vital part of the balance game and it may be why so many lose their first account or two.

Diversification in Forex means trading on multiple seperate pairs. This is to reduce your risk of major news events, market instability, and reddit memes from affecting your account in a negative way. The common adage of ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" is definitely the case, you wouldn't want all of your money in a USD pair during an election or riot of the capitol building for example as the uncertainty of the market could trigger a stop loss far past where you wanted it due to Slippage.

However, trading EVERY single major, minor and exotic pair will also kill your account in a different way. Being split among so many ""baskets"" you are sure to lose a few eggs before they rot in the hot afternoon sun. In traders terms, you won't be able to monitor all of them at the same time to get good signals, as well as each pair you trade will have different news to watch, different setups that work and different strategies in total. This would lead to you spreading your account so thin that the losses exceed your wins just due to volume alone.

The third trap of diversity in forex is diversification through a base currency. If all of your trades have one side being USD for example, it reduces the amount of news and major events you need to consume by half, however unexpected Volatility in the USD market could kill all of your trades at once.

So what is the solution to this seemingly complex balancing act? There's bad news for that, there is no one size fits all solution. You will have to decide how many pairs you are comfortable trying to remember Calender events, Entry strategies and other factors i may not be thinking about.

I may not be a financial advisor, and I hope I never am but I can recommend trying to stick with three or so of the Major pairs if you are just starting out in forex, as well as reading through the comments to see how other people attack this hurdle. 

After you get comfortable and understand yourself and Forex better you could move to the Minor pairs or even Exotics but they are unique and react entirely different from the Major pairs so do your research first before attempting them.

Anyways, that was my Ted Talk for today. Please feel free to agree or disagree in the comments but keep it civil. Also for any new traders that may be lurking around, I highlighted keywords to look up with capitalization, it may help your search.

Problem is with a higher time frame the stop loss and the profit target would be much further away. And to get a 2% risk for a wide stop loss I need to be using a much smaller lot size. 

But for the amount of time taken to close out a trade on the higher time frame the profit is not too good. 

I was wondering whether it would make sense to risk more on the higher time frame since there will be less noise, and I would less likely to get stopped out by random spike. And if the trade does seem to move against me I can still close it early.

- No entry after 12 pm CST.
- Mon/Fri — trade if great setup.
- Tues-Thurs — trade zone breaks.
- Determine previous structure for SL
- Use that SL to determine lot size (3% for me)
- Enter at the zone retest (lower timeframe)
- Set TP at 10-30 pips depending on price action, structure and momentum. If leaving chart, set it conservatively. 
- Set SL below or above previous structure.

Exit Phase: 
- Automatic. 
- Review outcome and adjust plan accordingly after multiple confirmations of pair behavior or poor analysis, etc.

P.S. When I have enough live experience with this strategy I will share the success rate for my account. I have traded it several times and mostly only lose due to too tight of a stop. (GBPUSD wicks all the way to the other side of the consolidation channel but not into opposite zone sometimes. I will watch that pair and manually close many times now)","self","https://redd.it/lbx598"

Even if it goes our way, we are not certain how far it will go and we cannot control it but what we can definitely control is how much we can let it go against us. Here comes the risk management.

Let's play with simple mathematical equation but before that we need to make some assumption. Everyone's winrate is different but for the sake of easy understanding let's keep it **50/50** and run this equation for **100** trades.

Now if we risk only **1%** on every trade and we target RtoR of only **1.5** then after 100 trades our ROI would be whopping **25%**.

I know many of you seasoned traders would be thinking that to maintain **1.5** RtoR with **50/50** winrate is very difficult than it sounds but my post is not for them. Many of you would also be thinking that we should not cap our RtoR and let our profits run but this post is not for them either.

This post is for those who don't even think twice before betting **10%** or more of their account in one trade or even worse some enter without a Stoploss. They want to make ROI of **250%** but don't realize if they lose 7 trades in a row then their account would go down by 50% after which they need to make ROI of 100% to breakeven with so much of emotional baggage of losing 7 trades in a row. And the chances of losing 7 trades in a row are 1 in 128 which is much more possible than making ROI of **250%**.

This post is for those who attempt for RtoR of 3/5/7 without first consistently achieving RtoR of 1.5. They want to make ROI of 100%/200%/300% but don't realize that the winrate will substantially reduce with the increase in RtoR. Then they come complianing why price takes ages to hit their TP or returns back to hit their stoploss as if the market is conspiring against them.

Now many of us are well aware of above equation but we still fail. We humans are doomed to fail because of our emotions like greed and fear; fomo and panic. We must master **discipline** and **patience** and must believe in our system and target long term. We must believe that slow and steady wins the race in the end.

I know it is very difficult to maintain **1.5** RtoR with **50/50** winrate over time but if we risk only 1% per trade then we are in the game forever and sooner or later we are going to reach there if no more.

**So all the new traders out there, first learn to control your emotions and how to apply proper risk management and then search for the winning strategies.**

Disclaimer: I am not a mathematician or statistician so there may be some mathematical errors in above but the idea is to manage the risk properly. Point is you can get good returns even with minimal risk.

EDIT: One important thing I forgot to address earlier. Stoploss must be defined first and the lot size has to be calculated accordingly and not the reverse.  For example, you want to long USDJPY at 105 and your Stoploss is at 104.80. If you have $1000 and want to risk 1%; the lot size should be only 5,256 units and your TP can be at 105.30 for 1.5 RtoR. You should not long 20,000 units and then set your Stoploss at 104.948 to keep your max loss at $10. If your broker does not allow you to trade small lots then either switch the broker or increase your capital or stop trading as there is no other way to manage your risk in that case. This lot size calculation can be easily done on tradingview or through other sources. ","self","https://redd.it/lc62nl"

So a little about myself: I've been trading going on 6 years now, first started in the stock market then moved to the forex market after a few years unsuccessful trading stocks.  
  
I like to think I'm not a lazy person, I'm willing to put in work into things I'm interested in, I believe the amount of studying education material on trading and spending time backtesting attests to that...  
  
But that's the thing, I feel I put in too much work and effort studying, backtesting, reading... for the lack of results I'm achieving. I've backtested so many strategies that I've lost count, crunched so much data for so many hours that my eyes bleed (figuratively speaking) yet I'm still struggling.  
Only a small number of those strategies that I've spent time backtesting actually produce a return that I find attractive (in theory), so the one I like I put into practice.  

This is where my frustration begins. Clearly the only reason I would begin trading a strategy I've backtested is because it provides an edge over the market after an extended period of trading using the strategy, yet it seems the moment I begin using the strategies they produce loss after loss after loss in a manner that isn't natural for said strategy.  
  
Now I have a pretty good idea of what you're thinking if you've read this far: ""You're most likely not following the rules of your strategy"", however I really don't believe that to be true. The rules I set for all of these strategies are rigid and cover concepts such as directional bias, allowed time to execute trades, allowed days to execute trades, stop loss and take profit placements, entry triggers, position sizing, minimum risk to reward ratio for a trade to be taken, and I follow them all meticulously and without fail.  
  
So because of all that I'm truly at a loss on how to progress from here. Again, I don't know exactly what I hope to get from posting this, I don't know if anyone will even take the time to read all of this, and I don't much expect anyone to care enough or have the answers I need to get past this cycle in stuck in...","self","https://redd.it/lciat9"

I was trying to figure it out and i'm a bit confused.

How can you loose money while buying stocks ? the way i understand if i buy stock lets say 1$ each and i buy 1000 of them . And their price goes down to 0.50$. I havent lost my money i only lost value in my stock i'd only loose if i cash out but if i keep my stock for a year or more it might go up again . ofcourse it might never go up or company might go bust and i might need to cash out but so far the way i see you only really loose if you cash out and not keeping stocks. Long term investments seems like pretty good idea to invest if it works like that i might be wrong . so if somebody could explain how it really works","self","https://redd.it/lcj5el"

I hope all the newbies in forex read this. 

I started learning forex after a friend approached me to join his MLM scheme. I would never fall for this crap and being an international student in canada I didn't want to lose whatever money I had. I searched about forex and decided that this is something that could make me serious money. This was back in the summer of 2018. 

I watched YouTube videos and started studying all kinds of patterns and candles. Let me save you the trouble, you don't have to memorize them, just keep in mind that if you see a candle or pattern like that while trading there's a possibility that price might do the things that you read about regime learning. Remember it's just a possibility don't go selling on every rejection candle. 

I started with 200$ and scaled it to 500$ pretty soon. That is what I call beginner's luck. Do not ever fall for that. When you win a few trades don't up your lot sizes because you will lose and when you lose you'll lose big. 

At the start of 2020 I had a co-op job and I woke up at 3am every day just to trade the London session. By this time I learnt from my mistakes after I lost all of my gains and margin called my account. I was making consistent 10% gains on my 1000$ account. 

In April I decided to join a prop firm. For me FTMO seemed perfect since if I'm not able to make my target in a month but I don't break any rules I will get a free repeat. 

Now after 4 months of consistent trading I was really confident but I couldn't pass the 10k!! Although I didn't break any rules so I got a free repeat. After getting free repeats for over 4 months I finally passed in October. 

Now I've gotten a few payments from FTMO and I can say they are legit therefore I'm going for the 100k. 

What I'm saying is don't waste your money with prop firms if you're not trading consistently. If you are prop firms are the way to go. 

Yes and about today's big spike in GBP. In forex you have to be aware of news. Go to forex factory and go to the calendar tab. You'll see all the events happening throughout the week and it says what currency it should be affecting. If any folder has a red or orange color to it then expect such spikes and drops 2 mins before and 2 mins after that news event. Look at the forecast value before the news and when the news comes out you'll see the actual value. In forex factory you'll see if actual greater than or smaller than forecast is good for bad for the currency. 

Today's news event all data was exactly same as forecasted which was good for GBP. So the spike

I'm not saying I'm an expert in forex and you guys should 100% listen to me but I think I've come a long way and if I had to tell my 18 year old self four years in the past this is what I'd say.","self","https://redd.it/lcj7sx"

I'm currently on the $100k Classic Model and I've had consistent bi-weekly payouts to my paypal account and I'm on track to get a side live account with an equity of $15,000. These are my thoughts on why Funding Talent is a better alternative than FTMO for day-traders starting out:  


1. ***The consistency rules***. There needs to be a trading plan for you to be a profitable day-trader and Funding Talent enforces that with their consistency rule. Risk per trades needs to be consistent and the number of trades you take per day/ per week as well. In my opinion, a trading plan is the most important element for you to be **profitable.**  

2. ***Bi-weekly cash bonuses.*** This is only for the classic model, which I recommend. They payout 10% of the profit you made every 2 weeks. So for example, if you were to make $5,000 on the first 2 weeks -$500 usd will be paid out to your paypal etc. And if at the end of the month you profited $10,000 -another $1000 usd will be paid out as well. While also putting in up to $5,000/month to your other account, the **live account**.  

3. ***Live account/demo account mechanics.*** So while trading on a demo account getting cash bonuses every two weeks, you will also have a side account, the live account where if you're able to attain $15,000, you will have access to it *while* still having access to your demo account, getting paid out bi-weekly and adding up to $5,000/month to your said live account. This allows you to stack your pay outs as well as growing your live account at the same time.  


While you may say FTMO has lesser restrictions and more freedom with the amount you are trading compared to Funding Talent, **that** is exactly the reason why I say Funding Talent is superior. Most traders gamble/luck their way to complete the challenge and end up blowing their 100k account almost immediately. This is due to freedom of trading and over-trading/over-leveraging as a whole.

With Funding Talent's classic model, you can slowly make your way to a larger and larger capital while having the mindset of not over-trading and having a plan drilled into your brain, making you a much much consistent trader than most people.

Well that is my perspective on Funding Talent, and my opinion is that it is for people who would want to go into Full Time day trading but do not have the capital.

I believe this happens because I don't follow my trading plan 100% of the time. If I follow my plan, I'd have profits and losses but profits outweigh the losses. I know I should just follow my plan....but it's EASIER SAID THAN DONE. It's really frustrating me.

Have we been scammed if I pay this 450? It’s annoying because the broker never told us about paying different fees.

It's NFP later, this is EURUSD chart. What do u think will be the movement?

The maroon & orange color blocks are Order Blocks (my assumption based on M15 - H4 time frames).

The Yellow & Green FBNC seem fulfilled at 138.2% & 161.8% respectively. USD has been going up for 4 days consecutively, it's currently down.

I think USD will give back some gains today, EURUSD will move to at least 1.20100 (S/R & orange order block).","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/zXYR6lxOHTsqhudH11VIopez4KC1NejmueedE-w-MYA.jpg","https://redd.it/ld4edm"

**Best trade:**[ https://www.tradingview.com/x/AvrRMJOX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AvrRMJOX/) 1.92R

**What went well?**

\-Stuck to my plan and entered on the close of the engulfing. I was slow entering order so entry was off from where I wanted.

\-Since last post, I've focused on trade management. I am 75% happy for this trade. I scaled out for profit a) after big move b) loss of momentum at 'bottom box' (Thank you for this mini system u/Vanguer !).

**What could've gone better?**

\-After closing out for the day, price dropped the next candle, however, no one went broke taking profits and was eager to cook my chicken nuggets...

\-I could pre-emt the close to get my tickets in ""on time"" as entry and first exit are far from candle close

**What went well?**

\-This was in my plan

**What could've gone better?**

\-I sold after the inside bar, expecting a continuation of the move, however, price retraced further. After reviewing historical ""one bar pullbacks,"" I noticed they are a lot more likely if a doji is printed, but not so common with other candlestick patterns. This review has improved my plan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had a good start to the week, however after two losing trades on Wednesday, I felt a bit ""on tilt."" This made me nervous and I didn't take a trade that afternoon because I lacked confidence. I'm hoping I can become less emotional as I trade more. For the next week, I'm going to try and focus on holding longer because I'm catching pips, I'm not catching R. (112 pips with stops around 5 pips).

I’ve been trying different types of trading and recently started trying to scalp, which has so far been my favourite, but I have a very simplistic, and to put it bluntly, shit strategy.

I trade GBPUSD and EURUSD on the 1 minute time frame almost exclusively. To decide whether to enter a trade, I look at tested resistance and support, wait til it hits either side and enter. 

The entire trade might range 3-5 pips, with 0.5-1 pip of spread. I like to put my R:R to 1.5 but I often end up closing at around 1 when it hits the first weak resistance cos it’s always 50:50 if it will come down again.

So far I’ve been decently profitable  (relative to the capital I’m risking at around 1/2000 per trade as I’m still practicing)  with about 10 profitable trades a day to maybe 2-5 negative trades.

Has it just been luck so far that I’ve been decently profitable? Cos I wouldn’t call myself experienced by any metric. If it is just luck, then why doesn’t scalping like this work? 

I know people say 1 minute support and resistance doesn’t mean anything, but if you look at charts you can see obvious lines. If I’m totally retarded please put it nicely.","self","https://redd.it/ldjkjy"

So on Monday this week I entrusted someone with a managing an account. (I know exactly what your thinking, ""Why would you do that lmao"")

So basically I run my own account but still go out and work etc at the same time and I wanted to have another ""Managed account"" running in the background that would work as a supplementary to my income if I was ever working or wanted to take a week off.

I entrusted Feral Forex with it as from everything I'd seen being a part of his Forex/Indices/Crypto signals groups and having his quite well done guide he seemed trustworthy. And due to the nature of my account, he couldn't withdraw any money, only trade with it and me send him his split. What could go wrong?


This guy puts 3 0.5 lots on gold longs, on a £2000 account with 1:500 leverage... The account was pretty much blown by him within 6 hours....

After asking why the hell it happened his only retort was ""I didn't expect gold to drop so quickly"" and then saying he doesn't cover losses after I say look ok these things happen, if you send me the money that was lost I'll put it back in the account and we can start again from there that way you'll also get your money back.

He then chose to ignore me and block me after I call him out for what he did on his Instagram posts.

I know you probably will all think I'm dumb and yeah you're right I feel pretty dumb for putting so much trust into someone...

Just a question i have in regards to the coorelation between the movement/daily fluctuations of the price of a given stock to the overall volume traded per day over the span of a given time period

Lets say for example over the span of 1 year (365 days), x stock has an all time yearly low of 10 and an all time yearly high of 12. looking at a graph, the line is essentially flat.

1. does this mean that the amount of buys and the amount of sells were pretty much even, meaning since the price of the stock stayed essentially the same, the amount of buys and sells canceled each other out - thus leading to a flat graph (volume of buys = volume of sells)?

and second scenario:
lets say all of a sudden, the price shoots up from ~10 to 200 in exactly a week (7 days) and then back down from 200 to ~10 in exactly another week (7 days). 

2. for this to happen, does this mean that the volume bought to bring the price to 200 in a week has to be roughly the same amount of volume sold to bring the price back down to 10? 

my apologies about the dumb question, just something ive been wondering about. hopefully my question makes sense. 

again, just wondering if the movement (essentially length of the candlestick) has any coorelation to the amount of stocks bought or sold. so if two candlesticks have the same length, you can assume that the amount of stocks traded on x time period was roughly the same

Thanks for any help i can get in regards to this!","self","https://redd.it/ldq26l"

Well so, I'm starting to read Trading in the Zone (AMAZING by the way) and watching some other trading psychology videos, and one thing I've been thinking about is, how the landscape of trading has changed since at least that book was written.

Do the principles still apply? I'm sure that A LOT of retail traders are using HFT algorithms and bots, and I'm sure that changes a bit how the market moves in some way...

The only logical explanation I can give, other than this is actually possible, is that the simulator I am using doesn't represent the real thing. 

I've made $3,000 in the past half an hour. Like, if I were to do this (big IF I am successful) several hours a day, every day, this is something around $10 - $14 million a year. No way.

Getting back into trading, I've realized that the two post important factors for this profession are: psychology, and risk management.

In studying psychology, hearing podcasts, reading, etc, I've realized something that is true about all this: you're not gonna win every time. And you have to deal with that.

Here's the thing though: if we even dream or think about doing this for a living, well... We will need money to pay our bills... Right? And what if we keep losing money for one month in a row? which, honestly? Could happen, I would assume. And I imagine it has happened even to the very best.

I would imagine that at that point, it's not a matter of just taking some losses and dealing with it... It's a matter of, well... Either ""not being able to pay your bills"", or losing so much trading that you have no money for anything else anymore. The markets won't matter, and this is always a risk of doing this.

I don't know if I'm making any sense here, but I'd like to know what you guys think about all that. Thank you! Also, if you need me to clarify anything I've said, just say the word.","self","https://redd.it/le1732"

I will open a short position at the break of SL at 1.20173. My SL will be the level of 1.20173. b) An acceptable return of the price to 1.20173 and an upwards movement towards the high targets. That would be a healthy reaction and I would open a long position at the break of 1.20483. c) the price continues directly its course towards the high targets but does not manage to exceed the test level of 1.20890 and returns. If 1.20483 breaks down I will open a short position with SL the recent high of the price around the test level. Note here that if the price hits the target of 1.19012 we will have the redefinition of point 3 lower for the red Wolfe Wave pattern. So be cautious!

The notion of a currency as a relative store of value against each other currency makes for a complex mesh where each one has a varying relationship with each other one. So, the concept of, for example, Eur/Usd is itself a multi variate relationship because not only do they fluctuate directly between each other but they also fluctuate through every other currency in a two step translation and so on for 3 steps, 4 steps etc.

So, if one assumes that across this complex mesh, each possible path from currency x to currency y must produce the same end result, is it not therefore the case that the global mesh of relationships between currencies (edges vs vertices) is a living system such that any change cannot exist in a vacuum and that every fluctuation must affect every relationship.
OR , there exists an opportunity (if even fleeting) to multiply currency by judiciously selecting a path.

The same concepts must notionally exist across the mesh of cryptocurrencies too. Thoughts?","self","https://redd.it/leqfev"

Let’s assume a bid/ask rate of 1.1000 x 1.1005, a margin factor of 2%, and a newly opened account with $2,000. Our trader decides that they want to place a short EUR/USD trade for €20,000. Because the quote is Euro’s priced in terms of U.S. Dollars, €20,000 would be the same as $22,000. We are using the bid price – first in the quote – since our trader is opening a short position). The $22,000 would be the notional size of the lot. The margin to open the position would be $440 ($22,000 x 0.02). This would leave our trader with $1,560 in free or ‘available’ margin. The pip value on the position would be $2.00 per pip, since this is a U.S. Dollar denominated account and we’re trading a pair based in U.S. Dollars. So, the $1,560 that the trader has in free margin would allow for 780 pips to be lost before a margin call would happen ($1,560/2 = 780). But let’s assume that the hypothetical trade found its way into the money. With a slide, the price on EUR/USD went down to 1.0805 x 1.0810, and the trader decided they wanted to close the lot. They’d have to buy back to cover the position, which would be done at the second rate in the quote, or the ‘ask price’. Our trader would be covering €20,000 at a rate of 1.0810, for total proceeds of $21,620; amounting to a net gain of 190 pips. The original cost of the trade was $22,000; but now the trader covers the position at a value of $21,620 – leading to a $380 difference which would be realized as profit on the trader’s short position. Once the trade is closed, the margin is returned to the account and the trader’s net account value is now $2,380.'

I have 2 questions 

1. How is the pip value on the position 2 dollars? is this because the lot size is 20,000? 
2. how is it a gain of 380 when the price went from 1.1000 to 1.0810? 

Thanks in advance. Very new to all of this.","self","https://redd.it/lfc795"

Even if the price keeps going down, its not like it will stay there for a really long period of time like months. Could i not just wait for the price to jump back up to the point in which i make profit, even if it is very minimal. In other words, as a trader you expect the market to go in the opposite direction you were hoping, but only for a short time.

I’ve been doing a lot of my own research and knowledge building over the last couple months and decided to start a practice account this week with Oanda. 

Now...I completely understand that its not a millionaire over night vibe and that it will take a lot of time to build consistent profits with a small account. 

My main query here is that you see so many fx traders on social media (you know the ones) and they share their clients profit successes. They aren’t making huge profits, but trades are coming in with some around £10, £20 the odd £45. Small profits, but thats what i’m looking to make. They advertise this with accounts as little as £250 which would be the perfect amount for me to get started with. 

So why when i’m using my demo account, the profits i’m making off £100 - £1000 trades so low? Are these ‘success stories’ not legit? 

I want to start with around £100-£300 and build, but I don’t want to do that if my profits are going to be 0.01 for 30-40 pips. 

Apologies if my nooby talk comes across the wrong way. I just want to begin trading with a small amount to build my skills, but the numbers i’m seeing my demo account just don’t make it worth it.","self","https://redd.it/lfo4e1"

Now they're giving me some examples, and I am completely lost. I think the pips are where I am losing touch with it. My questions are bolded in brackets, if y'all could please help me understand what's happening so I can get back on track. This is the example given:

**S&P 500 and Non-Farm Payrolls**

Firstly, we will look at the effect of Non-farm Payrolls on the S&P500. Non-farm payrolls is the most closely watched indicator in the Employment Situation, considered the most comprehensive measure of job creation in the US. Such a distinction makes the NFP figure highly significant, given the importance of labour to the US economy. On a whole if the number beats expectations we are looking to buy the market and alternatively if the reading is worse we are looking to sell.

The market expectations for this figure were 181k ***\[Is this figure indicated on the chart below? How can you tell what the market is currently trading at? How does 2925 pips, for example, relate to the monetary value?\]***. Below is a chart of how the S&P500 was trading prior to the release of the number. 

https://preview.redd.it/o5l2ppnf9cg61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe5207fb61ad0ae2e0d6b1c63e4e21604c3166c

The number came out at over 263k. What do you expect to happen?

Below is a chart of this market after the number has been released. ***\[Where exactly on the chart can you see when the number came out? And again, how do pips reflect the expectation of 181k and the released number of 263k? How does that come down a 25 pip change?\]***

As you can see, the market has rallied higher moving approximately 25 pips after the number or about 0.6%. If you had invested $1m ($5000 trading capital typically required), the profit would have been a around $6000 in a matter of minutes, leaving you with 120% profit on your trading capital. ***\[I don't understand where any of these numbers or values came from\]***

If you don't like him/his framework, that's fine. If you do, then I've got three little tips for you:

(1)  Try adjusting the ATR.

I know he says not to touch the ATR. But his word isn't (or shouldn't be treated as) gospel. Play with the ATR. Your whole system is going to be built around it - so optimize it. For nearly every indicator/system I've tested, an ATR of 21 has been superior (average about 1% added to overall win rate). This doesn't mean that 21 is the ""best"" setting - it simply means that 14 isn't necessarily the best setting. 

(2) Back test *with* the EVZ (rather than slap it on at the end).

If you're going to follow his word and not trade (or alter your trading) when the EVZ is below a certain threshold, then you need to know that your system ""likes"" that constraint. Again, if you're going to use the EVZ as per his recommendations, then you should optimize your system to work with it. (Also, play with the EVZ threshold - you might find some fun things. Like, **maybe**, an entirely different algo works wonders when it's below your threshold). 

(3) Test both out of sample and in sample data. 

I know he says to go back and test for the last few years of data, optimize on that data, then start forward testing. That's fine, but there's a quicker way to get a sense of the robustness of your system. 

Perform your initial back testing/optimizing on, lets say, data from 2015 to 2018. Then, test (**but do not optimize)** your system against data from 2018 to 2020. If it falls apart for the last two years, then you've probably got a bunk system (most likely curve fit to your initial data set). If it performs similarly (or better yet, performs even better), then you've probably got something good. I'd still recommend forward testing, but this allows you to compare systems much more quickly (rather than committing to \~6mo of forward testing before finding out you need to start over).

**Bonus** (4) Spend the time to learn how to programmatically back test. Seriously, it's worth the time.","self","https://redd.it/lgbuig"

Hello,

I'm looking for an indicator or to make a custom alert myself in pine script (tho i have no idea about coding), that would alert me when the price has risen more than the curent value of the ATR.

My idea would be like this:

If (curent candle closed price - previous candle open price ) > curent ATR value

then i get an alarm on tradingview platform

But i have no idea how to code such thing ( tho it seems pretty easy, yes i'm stupid). Does anybody has such knowledge and is willing to help me with it ?

The whole strategy would be to trade mean reversions and this to be the trigger for it when it's outside of BB or other kind of volatility indicator.

Opinions are always welcomed ;)","self","https://redd.it/lgdzve"

The UK economy has faltered at the start of the year as the manufacturing sector registered output at a 3-month low in January. The sector grew at a slower pace of 54.1% as Brexit transitions and covid-19 restrictions hampered supply chains and dampened exports. By contrast, the services sector experienced the fastest decline in business output in 8 months, dropping to 39.5% in January. Lockdown measures have seen orders falling and therefore job losses have started climbing. One silver lining for the sector is growth expectations for this year; with output expectations reaching a 7-year high.

&#x200B;

The US labour market serves as an indicator of economic recovery and recently, there have been worrying signs that highlight just how protracted the recovery is going to be. A mere 45,000 new jobs were added to the US economy in January against a forecast of 85,000 and a revision of 227,000 job losses in December. Average hourly earnings dropped to 0.2% in January after spiking to 1% in December. The unemployment rate fell to 6.3% during the month thereby indicating that more workers left the US labour market at the start of the new year. 

&#x200B;

According to the Caixin manufacturing PMI survey, growth in China’s services sector slowed at the start of the year, with business activity weakening at the fastest pace in 9 months. Fewer exports sales and falling consumer demand have been blamed for the slowing output. Japan’s Au Jibun manufacturing report indicated that the sector has moved into contraction in January. The reduction in production has been a persistent problem however, new ‘state of emergency’ restrictions implemented by trading partners have resulted in the sector’s pullback. An output of 49.8% has been registered for the month.","self","https://redd.it/lgjhmu"

Hi everyone. I am new to both r/Forex and Reddit. I wanted to create a helpful post here to all beginners starting out, mainly because reading through this sub I notice a lot of beginners deviating from what is a ""good"" learning path. This is not a strategy nor does it contain any tips for technical or fundamental analysis, but should provide some insight into subject rarely discussed. 

I also want to point out that English is not my mother language, so I do apologize for any grammar or spelling errors that might confuse you. If you get confused, just ask. 

# A good learning path

I have been trading for a few years and I have probably made every mistake in the book. I am still continuing to make mistakes, its only natural and part of what makes us human. But talking to new traders, I come to conclusion that mistakes are either frowned upon or feared. People usually do not like to admit they were wrong or easily blame any mistakes on distraction or ""smart money"" hunting them down. **Learning from mistakes is essential to develop as a trader**. But there is one thing often overlooked. It is better to lose when you are wrong then win. This is something very important to keep in mind, as you should **always** hope your trade goes bust when you are wrong. Winning when you are wrong can have potentially catastrophic consequences. 

Let me give an example:

You sit in your car under influence (alcohol) and you decide to drive from point A to point B. Reaching point B without an accident is worse then hitting a tree. Because success when you are wrong will change your perception of reality. If you drive from point A to point B, without a accident, you might convince yourself that you are capable of operating a vehicle under influence, and you will probably have no problem doing so again in the future. Hitting a tree, will probably prevent you from driving drunk again as you now have understood that your either not capable of driving drunk, or that it was the wrong thing to do. But if you succeed, you might keep on driving eventually hitting and killing a child playing on the street. 

The same thing goes when trading. When you succeed when you are wrong, you might hit your 3:1 TP for that particular trade, but you will go on losing three times that before you realize something is wrong. 

My point is, do not fear losses. They are what makes us grow. You **absolutely** have to lose to learn. There is a common misconception that you can learn and practice on a demo account and once you go live you just bring that knowledge over and you will succeed. This is far from true. You should be ready to blow out one or two account before you start getting somewhere. You will be totally comfortable with charts and decision making once you spent on average 10,000 hours in front of chart. For people with higher intelligence, this will be lower. 

# Evaluating your strategy

When testing and evaluating your strategy most people will look at historic charts and think that their strategy is valid and then go on trading on a live account. Back testing is something that must be done, but rarely helps you in any way. The human mind works a little different when you want evaluate your own creation. You will naturally be drawn to the successful results of your back test more. This means that when looking at a historic chart, your eyes will only catch those times your strategy did work. You will ignore or not see the times it didn't. Let's for the sake of argument assume you enter on a 61.8% FIB retrace. This is your strategy. Now when you start looking at a chart, you will automatically start looking for any fall or rise that retraced. You will then take your tool and drag it from the top to bottom of the original move and then see that price bounced on the fib level. You are happy that it worked and move on to find the next one and next one after that. But what about that fall, which reversed and went all the way up? You are automatically ignoring that. Your eyes will only see what you want them to see, and you always want to prove yourself right.

When back testing, always and I do mean always, aim to prove yourself wrong. Do not just look at a historic chart when doing this. If using Tradingview for example jump to an older date and use the replay mode. If you are not using Tradingview use Forex Tester or any other software that lets you live trade historic charts. This is the best, yet still somewhat flawed, way of back testing a strategy. But a strategy will never prove itself unless it is traded live.   


# Understand value

There is a lot of talk about smart money, distribution and accumulation and tons of other perspectives that will make you doubt the validity of the market or think that it is rigged against you. It's not. It is just very very complex. Forex is much more complex than other markets, specially the stock market. 

Forex has no real accumulation and distribution. Forex has perceived value that is a result of fundamental policies like inflation, interest rates and GDP growth. One country economy measured against another. There is no underlying asset to own and distribute/accumulate like stocks. This is a heavy leveraged market where you can have a bank account funded with JPY but you can still long or short the AUDUSD even tho you do not own neither AUD nor USD. 

The Forex markets majority transactions are utilitarian, it means that it is used to pay for something. It can be tourists wanting to exchange money, it can be a company that want to pay for goods or services. The majority of the volume in Forex are for utilitarian uses. These people do not care about the future exchange rate. They will get the exchange rate that currently reflects the **perceived value** of that currency. The currency's perceived value changes as different policies are implemented to correct or promote inflation, or any other fundamental event that can have this effect like wars, tsunamis, unemployment, elections etc. 

The ""smart money"" people mention in Forex is commonly mistaken with the smart money in the stock market. The smart money in Forex consists of two major participants, the large speculators and the commercial interest. The large speculators always add to their position when it is trending, and the commercial always trade in the opposite direction of the trend, mainly because they are hedging another investment for example in a foreign stock market. So thinking the market is rigged against you, specially in a deep and liquid market like the Forex market, is not entirely correct. You just don't understand value. 

Value is very hard to identify on a chart because it can shift so frequently and suddenly. But the main rule of thumb is that whenever price is in a range, that is the currently perceived value range. How it got there, matters as well. A fast climb in prices which then ends in a range, tells us that this is pair is being valued higher than before. Here is an example:

&#x200B;

[EURUSD Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/bufudkbcxlg61.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=47a4ae0856b1927c4cb8518be50eb2d33b61edea)

You can see that price went straight up, and ended in a range. This is the current perceived value. I see a lot of people starting to immediately go short once price starts to turn around lower. But the truth is, as long as that value does not shift lower, anything below this range will actually be discounted prices since we are lower than the perceived value. I will go into more detail about this when discussing risk. 

But the value (equilibrium) is extremely important to understand so you can position yourself correctly (or stay away from trading) as you use value as confluence to your existing strategy. Do not ignore the equilibrium in the market, it will pay off in the long term trust me on this. 

# Risk

This is the most important part where basically all beginner traders get it wrong. Risk is NOT just risk reward ratios. I will not go into detail on RR ratios, as there is plenty of information on this subject and you have to adjust that to whatever fits your strategy and win rate. But understanding when a position is riskier then usual is vital. To understand risk you need to properly understand volatility. 

When volatility is high, risk is naturally higher. But, the reward can be higher as well. So naturally, you want to be able to predict the next volatility expansion in your desired direction. 

Volatility goes up when liquidity goes down. As something gets volatile it is usually because there is a lack of liquidity on one side of the market, either the buy or the sell. Market makers (liquidity providers) always want a non-volatile market where each transaction can be matched properly with least amount of risk and just sit back and earn the spread. But the reality is far from such a perfect world. When volatility goes up to much, spreads increase as market makers needs to compensate for the risk of not being able to match the order. Liquidity gaps occur, slippage occurs etc. And when the market is slow, spreads are usually lower which in turn means lower transaction costs. 

Now, the true resistance and support in the market comes from volatility contractions -> volatility expansions. 

&#x200B;

[EURUSD Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/mifls9pdxlg61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc3d4d19e69187c47522f1280ddb9c10b8115c6)

When volatility decreases, there can be a new evaluation in the market and direction of least liquidity usually is obvious after that contraction ends. These zones are important as they have a fundamental basis to why they occur, how and what happens. I will not go into detail about this but if you want to learn more you can download and read the following papers by just googling them

*"" Foreign Exchange Market Microstructure and the WM/Reuters 4pm Fix "" by  P. S. Michelberger∗ and J. H. Witte*  

*"" The market microstructure approach to foreign exchange: Looking back and looking forward  "" by  Michael R. King, Carol Osler and Dagfinn Rime* 

*"" Microstructure of Foreign Exchange Markets "" by  Martin D.D. Evans† Dagfinn Rime‡*  

Now the basic rule of thumb is, to reduce risk (notice i used the phrase reduce risk and not increase wins)

\- Risk is increased when shorting below a value range, unless a new lower value range has been created

\- Risk is decreased when longing below a value range, unless a new lower value range has been created

\- Risk is lower when positions yourself on volatility contractions (smaller equilibrium)

\- Risk is higher when going against the trend (even when you respect the value ranges)

\- Reduce your exposure to market noise by widening stop losses

\- Always use higher time frame charts like the daily when you are in your first years of trading. Scale down when you are justifying your entry using whatever strategy you have  


Each trade is unique. Each entry is unique. Each stop loss is unique. Each pattern behaves uniquely. One pattern can one time lead to a range, one time go up and another time go down. Your most and primary objective should always be to reduce risk and exposure. Do not patternize the market, treat it uniquely. Do not build patterns in your head that say ""Whenever it does x and y I will buy"". Take risk and exposure into consideration every time and with a proper strategy and money management system you **cannot** fail.","https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/-yAwj8Qj27nfURvuo9XFVI16PNiRBAmrCphbxyT5Js0.jpg","https://redd.it/lgp555"

Been watching this setup this week, wanted to share it and get some opinions from any other break and retest traders, this pair has been in a long term downtrend, but hit a 6 year low on the 6th of January, made a reverse head and shoulders pattern, created new uptrend structure, broke out of the down trend line and is currently testing it as well as a level at 0.8915 which also happens to be the 61.8 fib and fits a new up trend line.

You think fundamentals are important but you don't know how to start? What is the right way to assess any economic number rather it is good or bad for the economy appearing in the economic calendar? I want to present a good way for this problem.

# Solution

A good way to find out what the released data is telling is to score every economic number according  if it is **normal** or **abnormal**.

To determine this we will work with the mean and standard deviation. Here an example:

[Everything what falls between -1 and +1 standard deviation is normal. We will score them with lower numbers. Any number outside is abnormal and gets a higher score.](https://preview.redd.it/73lwbnez5og61.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f0981c98804c1d716e6fe4aeb98a2d466e7d7e)

&#x200B;

[As we can see in our histogram, 74,68&#37; of all data falls between our first standard deviation. 97,44&#37; of all the released data falls between the second standard deviation.](https://preview.redd.it/re7xpr858og61.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2715906e57176e4c787cf3e9b114b95025b4e5)

[As you can see, what we do now is determining the mean of all CPI m\/m data with the score of 0. 2 positive standard deviations gets a score of 10. 1.5 negative standard deviations is scored with an -8. Anything above 2 positive standard deviations and beneath 1.5 standard deviations we expect an intervention of the Federal Reserve.](https://preview.redd.it/34qugl0z8og61.png?width=127&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0d917e1470692b7c5a54e37a2101a10bb9b997)

&#x200B;

**This approach is what we do for any important data which is released for each country.**

If the market respects this channel and horizontal support level, the next H4 candle closes above this trend line and horizontal support, prints any bullish price action candlestick signal then goes for Long and the target will be the next Resistance level.

The spread is the difference in interest rate payed out between two different assets. But the spreads that are especially taken in consideration by economists and regulators are the spreads between different government bonds. In order to calculate these spreads are usually used bonds that are considered risk-free like the US Treasury Bond or the German Bund. On the other side we take government bonds of countries that are considered riskier. The increase in the spread of the returns between the two financial products are usually sign of fear in the market place towards the riskier country’s ability to pay out its debt. For example, spreads between Germany and southern Europe countries strongly increased during the sovereign debt crisis that followed the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. When fear comes into place investors sell off bonds of risky issuers which causes interest rates to go even higher and making the crisis even worse, until a regulatory entity steps in. In the case we made previously, it was the European Central Bank which solved the problem. A strong rise in interest rates can cause very bad consequences for the overall economy because both individuals and companies will have to pay higher interests on their debts. This causes people to consume less and, in the end, people start losing jobs and companies go bankrupt and default on their debts. This means that it’s very important to insure stability.  If the rise in interest rates is dictated by the central bank instead, it’s usually done in order to contrast inflation so that people are more incentivized to save money rather than spending and using less leverage. This also pushes investors to go from riskier investments like stocks to safer bonds. This usually causes a drop in equities prices.","self","https://redd.it/lh5ald"

I'm ""training"" and fine tuning my strategy to meet FTMO rules, i have a quick question. If we have a 10.000usd account, and we should only trade 1% risk per trade. That will be around 100usd if my math doesn't failed me. But since we have the rule that we can't go below 90%, trading 100usd will be more like 10% as i can't loose more than 1k in a row. (i know, probability is not expected but still). But if i use 1% out of 1000, that will take too long to make the profit target.

Another thing, i forgot to ask, about restricted news, my strategy is expected to hold trade for a day or two or even more if is a good trade, how do you handle news, as they happened almost every day. Do you close, and the re enter with the same SL and continue from where it was if the price doesn't' change much? 

So the question is what is the recommend action?

I used to trade in 2015-2016 when I was around 20 and I was not very successful. I did learn A LOT about technical and fundamental analysis and I mainly traded a simple price action strategy. Too many indicators seemed to conflict with each other, especially if you’re looking at different time frames. Still, when I stopped, I was down money. However, keeping up with fundamentals and macro economics led me into majoring in finance. I am a senior now at a solid university and I credit forex to my current path. 

Recently I got back into forex. With my newfound knowledge in finance (risk management, long term outlook) my approach has changed. From when I started back up in October I am currently up about 15%. This is DEFINITELY not a solid indicator of long term success because I had a few negative months and a very strong positive month in January. 

Every professor teaches us that technical analysis is bullshit. Why try to do something that a computer can do way better than you? A very successful professor of mine (started his own hedge fund and started teaching out of boredom after being retired at 40) told us today that all technical indicators are accounted for by computers and algos, meaning it is impossible to have any competitive edge with technical analysis. He didn’t fully knock it, however, as he said that he can only view technical analysis/beating the market as successful in small cap, low volume assets. We all know the foreign exchange is the complete opposite of that. 

So basically, I just want to hear opinions from traders who have been successful year over year in generating profit. What do your monthly/annually returns look like? I’m not talking about $$ but percentage wise? Do you have a rebuttal to what my professor has said?","self","https://redd.it/lhb9jb"

First time post on this forum, I'm just curious does anyone else implement fundamentals along with macroeconomic data reports to understand how price moves in the market, Once I started using this method it became alot more clear on how the market moves, of course it's all priced in by banks & institutions but you can still capitalise on their small moves in the market which can be quite large for some retail traders. If you do so, it be cool to know if it's helped your trading strategy/style

Hi everyone! Since my last post I have been receiving so many messages in private it is hard for me to keep up and answer everyone in a satisfactory manner, so please, no hard feelings I will try to answer every single message the best way that I can. But the most recurring question I get is about my views on liquidity so I thought it would be best to explain it all.

*Note: Some of this content might be controversial for some readers. Most of this is based on years of trading and work in this field. Some are my own observations.*

I would also like to add that my last statement ""Price goes in the direction of least liquidity until liquidity is found"" has been challenged a lot on private messages. I respect everyone's opinion about the market and how it works, I am not saying at all that I am right or my way is the best way. This is just my view and perspective and you can decide to incorporate this into your trading the same way you can decide not to. I also noticed that a good amount of people had a hard time making sense of the pdfs i shared in my last post so after searching around the web to find a more easily understood explanation i bumped into [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vqZwZPvGIg&feature=youtu.be) This video will explain how spread (bid/ask) liquidity and supply/demand works. I also want to note that I am by no way affiliated with the creator of this video. I also would like to add that I do NOT agree with his views on volume and advertising of their software. I can almost certainly say that this software will only amplify your losses. So watch this video but ignore the part about volume and their software. If you already understood the pdfs from the previous post you can skip this video, if not watch it and the rest of this post might make more sense.

Again, as English is not my main language, I do want to apologize in advance for any grammar/spelling errors.

# Market manipulation

In the last post I denied that market manipulation exist in the FX market and it sparked a discussion. Let me clear up some things about this. I would not be surprised if FX market manipulation did exists, but there is no proof of this so far. The FX market is deeply liquid and manipulating it like they do in stocks or other less liquid assets is extremely difficult and expensive. There has been instances of major bank collusion and manipulation in the FX market which banks have pleaded guilty to in the past. Links are [here](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/five-major-banks-agree-parent-level-guilty-pleas) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_scandal). But there is one thing to be clear about here, these instances of manipulation was NOT designed to take your stop-loss or make the chart look bullish while it in fact was bearish. These instances are manipulation of WM Reuter 4 PM Fix and the LIBOR rates. To be quick about this, the banks colluded to f\*ck over their own clients who wanted to exchange foreign currency. To simplify, Bank A had a client that wanted to buy 1bn USD, Bank B had one who wanted to buy 300m USD etc etc. All these banks came together and told each other that they had a total sum of X USD that was going to be purchased in the coming day or two. To earn the MOST possible amount from spreads, they pumped the benchmark rates (LIBOR/WM Reuters 4PM) to get the best possible average benchmark rate just before the transaction took place. They did this by removing liquidity from the market (either buy or sell) to get the price to move just before the average rate benchmark to get the best spread possible when exchanging client currency. In other words, these manipulative moves did NOT hunt any stop losses, they did NOT alter the charts in a significant manner, they just increased the spread they earned during the benchmark window. Thats it. There is no other proof existing of stop loss hunting in the FX market, or manipulating the market to go in a certain direction. There are plenty of cases in other asset classes with backing evidence. FX has yet to provide this. Having said all this, I am not saying it is IMPOSSIBLE for market manipulation to exist, I deep down still believe there might be on some level, but failing to provide evidence for this disables me from applying this to my daily analysis. You should also know that the benchmark rates for fixed spreads during a certain window is slowly being phased out due to banks screwing over their clients and within a few years they will most likely be removed entirely.

Now, what I am about to explain about liquidity, might in many peoples eyes **look like market manipulation**, and maybe it is, but it can be explained logically using liquidity analysis.

&#x200B;

# Lack of liquidity

As you have read in the attachments in my previous post and/or in the Youtube video I attached, price will automatically move in the direction of least liquidity UNTIL it is found. Then the process starts all over again. So, some people may say that price goes into the direction of most liquidity, while this statement hold some truth, it lacks detail when saying it lack that.

Now the important thing to understand is why a lack of liquidity occurs and the reasons behind it. Because the majority of illiquid  (illiquid = lack of liquidity) moves in market might to most people look like market manipulation. But there are logical explanations for them all.

A lack of liquidity happens due to

* News events. Market makers will remove liquidity to reduce risk during high impact news events.
* Uncertainty. Elections, wars, earthquake, pandemics etc etc

A lack of liquidity can also occur due to technical reasons:

* After a range. During a range spreads are narrow and FX transactions can be made with lower than usual risk. This is for example why many big firms who need to buy or sell a large amount of a currency chose to do so during the Asian session. When a range has reached it limit and liquidity has dried up, market usually expands in one direction.
* Structural levels like tops, bottoms, channels, trendlines etc etc. Its natural that a previous top has a lack of buy liquidity.
* Low or high prices. The lower price drops, the less people are willing to sell. The higher price goes, less people are willing to buy.

Just to make it clear before I continue, a lack of liquidity usually is seen on the charts as a very fast move. In this case, the lower time frames illustrate this more accurately than the higher time frames.

&#x200B;

[All arrows represents candles where either buy or sell liquidity was lower](https://preview.redd.it/e5makp32ysg61.png?width=2541&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a7974be40dc66ae692599beaf58d87668eb399)

The important thing here is to know that such moves are independent of volume. Just to simplify this statement:

""1€ buy liquidity removed when the market has 2€ sell liquidity would theoretically move the market the same amount of pips that if 1bn € buy liquidity was removed when the market had 2bn € sell liquidity"".

I hope this makes sense. So, if the market suddenly moves a lot, it does not mean that volume was high. This can be seen during the 2020 Presidential election night and during news events. During election night the market moved extremely but it was not accompanied by any significant volume.

So now we know when market has a lack of liquidity naturally. These actions most often do not affect the market in any way, they are usually not very strong levels of support and resistance either. A top that lacks buy liquidity is only natural, it does not mean that this top will hold for another retest. What such actions does however, is affect the perception of the retail trader. One might think that the market is weak.

Lets now look at unnatural events where liquidity drops.

# Unnatural liquidity drops

When we have a technical structure in the market that points with high probability in one direction but does the exact opposite, this would be an unnatural liquidity drop. I might chose the wrong words for this, but ""unnatural"" is just the term I use internally, call it whatever you like.

One example would be a situation where you have a fixed low, but lowering highs, or what some people might call a ""descending triangle"". In this case, you are expecting price to go lower. Momentum is bearish and then price falls below to reverse and go back up. This would by many people be seen as market manipulation and stop loss hunting. The market had a lack of sell liquidity, where it should have had it, and it returned. This is an unnatural occurrence.

&#x200B;

[GBPUSD Hourly Chart. No news event involved in either of the illiquid moves](https://preview.redd.it/4mbagtut0tg61.png?width=2304&format=png&auto=webp&s=51372f13004017294724debf60c984cfdeb0fef0)

This is a good example of where unnatural liquidity drops happens. The market tried to change direction but so much bullish momentum still remains in this pair that no one wants to sell, not even where they should have sold. This leads to a lack of sell liquidity.

As I said earlier, the lower price drops, the higher the chance of a lack of sell liquidity. And the higher price goes, the higher the chance of a lack of buy liquidity. But what happens when there is a lack of sell liquidity in higher prices? This would also be considered unnatural

Sidenote: I am sure people will now say well this is how stop hunting works. True stop hunts like in the stock market has an equal amount of force on the opposite side. For example, in this case people would have put SELL STOP orders to enter the market once this triangle was broken. They would most likely place a BUY STOP (stop loss order) above the previous high. Once that ALSO was hit, we would have to see an equal force reaction there as well, but to the upside.

# Conclusion

This post was not meant to be a strategy, entry signal or any push in some direction on how you should analyze a chart. This is just meant as a complement to your existing strategy. It can serve as a confluence to your current strategy or to give some more detail and explanation to why some moves occur as they do. It is also a pointer that all fast moves does not necessarily mean strength or weakness. I hope this post was as much help to people starting out as my last one was.

I know it's stupid to say, but hear me out. I believe I've reached a point where I can trade well, the only issues is waiting for the right trade setups to happen.

Now I'll be at the computer for 12-24 hours a day and the setups don't happen. However, the minute I go to the toilet. It happens. I get back setup has already happened and it's too late to go in, or it's already past my profit calculation. I'll be at the computer for hours and setup won't happen, I go to feed the cat for 10 minutes, come back and the setup has already happened and gone.

This literally happens every day. Wait 3 hours for a setup, then I get a back spasm and have to lie down for 10 minutes. When I get up trade is gone. Wait 2 hours for a setup, then go for a quick stretch outside, come back in 5 minutes and the trade is gone. I can list endless scenarios of how this happens.

I'm can't say how frustrated I am. My strategy works, my analysis is usually correct, my predictions usually happen. I just like waiting for the right time to put them in. The problem is the entry moment always happens at the very same time I'm not at the computer. I can be watching the screen for 8 hours straight and nothing happens, but just go for a coffee  and then it does.

I've tried using some alerts and alarms and stuff but they don't work well. Half the time they don't actually ring. The other half they ring when I'm not at the computer, and when I'm not near the computer I don't hear them.

I also tried putting different orders too, but they don't seem to work well either (not for the way I do things at least).

So that's my frustration. How do you all deal with this?","self","https://redd.it/lhhky5"

Now we gonna find out where we can set good take profit levels. For that we have to detect strong resistance and support level which aren't always visible on the futures price chart..

Lets remember on 27 January the FED said they will keep interest rates low even when inflation exceeds their target inflation rate:

The Bank of England was in comparison very hawkish in their statement on 4th February:

Now you wonder where can I read all these informations? [Newsquawk](https://newsquawk.com/zerohedge) offers with Zero Hedge the opportunity to get high level news for currency trading. This is my everyday tool in trading. Forex Life is also a good website for news.

Even the dashboard tells us long UK and short US

[The current week began on 8 February. My typical entry would be near the fair price with a buy limit on GBP\/USD. You see the resistance line on the top. We gonna discuss why this is a good take profit level and why the price stopped there.](https://preview.redd.it/t343jlkvaug61.png?width=2344&format=png&auto=webp&s=8512f5cdc4ac799cae475f65426dfcd345b6368c)

[The CME Group provides us a free heat map of the option positioning of the large player. As you can see we have heavy calls on the price level of 1.385. The smart money refuses to trade the price over this level. Think of it like no one wants to buy at prices where other buyer would get an advantage of a cheap price. The opposite counts for heavy put option strikes which function as a support level. Now what can we say from this situation? We have 1790 options against us. In comparison to all other data its one of the highest. What we also see is that these 1790 options expire tomorrow at 11:59 a.m. EST. since the runtime of these kind of currencies are one week and you can read the days until expirations beneath the DTE \(days to expiration\).  That means if the upside pressure of the British pound persists until expiration, we might see a break through that level. Until then we have to accept it as the next major resistance level. Don't get me wrong, there are times where the buying or selling price is so high that it will break though any strong strike levels.](https://preview.redd.it/6m8bpixfbug61.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2955f650a72e9161ca061ce28f5aa0de74294b3)

You can also find important cross pair price levels by dividing for instance EUR/USD price with GBP/USD to get the EUR/GBP price level.

This method is very effective when price is moving to new highs or lows with no prior volume profile to get an orientation what is the next ""fair price"".

You can find this Options Heatmap [here](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/open-interest-heatmap.html). Don't forget to enable the weekly options in the menu bar called ""Expirations"".

If you think my content is valuable follow me. This weekend Im gonna post a trade opportunity for the next week backed with fundamentals.

\-Looking back it’s clear to see the market was just ranging. I was conscious of this and needed to sit on my hands at the time.

**Overall**

I had a good start to the week but I’ve took sub-par trades and it’s punished me; -0.79R for the week.  
For next week, I aim to keep out of sub-par trades, along with continuing to work out how to get more out of my winners.

I'm just in the middle of backtesting a break and retest strategy (found horrendous results for the USD/CAD). I was wondering what pairs are the best for trading these kinds of strategies. If you could give me insights into the best currency pairs through your own backtesting and/or experiences, this would be fantastic as it would quicken this process for me slightly.

Now, everyone recommends to do the normal plan, but doesn’t 5x leverage actually mean you’d be able to accelerate faster through the aggressive plan? Also 1:6 leverage makes it feel like progress would be incredibly slow, making it take forever to hit the next tier each time.

I recently got hired at a major financial company but in a non-financial role. However, even if it is not a financial position, it would be very beneficial for me to learn how the foreign exchange market works.

basically, what I'm asking is, Say I believe that the Euro is going to increase in value. So I want to buy $1000 worth of Euros, without actually buying it, as if it were a derivative. If the Euro rises, then my ""investment"" of $1000 is now worth $1500, and I can ""sell off"" my Euro stock. Sort of like I'm tracking the currency in USD, and making the difference off of it.

Is this how NDFs work for that matter? The settlement being paid in the ""free"" currency?

Thanks.","self","https://redd.it/lirb25"

I was in a great forex class last year. Learned a whole lot. Craziest thing was that we all chased monthly profits of 50% or more. The course leader asked: how many people can do that? > nobody put there hands in the air. Next he said: how many of you can do 10% each month if they wanted > everybody raised their hands. Then he said: so why are you here then you stupid fucks !!! (Lol). Confronting, but true. Bottom line we all used to much risk. Most of us around 3 to 5 percent per trade. And then quit because of draw down. Now i learned to trade with 0.25% and continue even in draw down. And i make 10% each month, and with compounding 250% a year. And managed to do so in 2020.

I know you'll say ""but daily is too slow for us day traders!"". 

Here, I want you to see that since you prefer quick moves or just lower timeframe trading - the daily chart could help. 


Below I'll show you a few ways one could have traded it. 



Firstly, like you've seen above - I find a significant price range I want to focus my trading in (_which I call zones_), then go to a better timeframe for entries. 


Now that price is trading within the zone, I don't panic or FOMO into selling because this is a daily supply zone. Also, it's always better to not be the first person selling - allow price to properly penetrate your zone before looking for opportunities.


#Price Is Showing Reversal Signs

Now that price has entered into the zone at least deeper than 60% https://imgur.com/a/DMaANU7, it's time to start looking for reversal signs.


__1st Entry__:

[This is](https://imgur.com/a/nCTEFSM) the first reversal sign being a bearish engulfing pattern. 

__Question is: How Do I Trade It?__

The first obvious one is, once the engulfing candle closes, you could just sell it at market price. Or...



The second one being, sell it when it comes back to the engulfing pattern range. How?

[Once you ](https://imgur.com/a/7nEp7vO) have marked up the H1 bearish engulfing pattern, go to a lower timeframe (M30 in this case) and sell when price comes back to the supply zone created by the pattern. 



**2nd Entry**: 

Price drops lower and makes a new low, we don't make nothing of it as it rallies past your first entry point to make a new high. This is brought to an immediate stop as selling momentum comes in, taking out the recent low made to make a new low.

Price has shown a very clear move that became really obvious to us, a break of the bullish price structure. If you could place a momentum line, it would have been broken by the bearish engulfing bar move. 

This created a Quasimodo price action structure which we are very much acquainted with as a reversal signal. **What makes it a confirmation you would ask?**

 > It is the removal of the new HL(higher low) to create a lower low (LL). This is to show that the momentum is now stronger from the top (selling momentum is in control). 

So you just connect the top of the H(left shoulder) and the head (higher high) with your tool and wait for price to come back to that level so you can start selling. Looks a little like [this](https://imgur.com/a/INLXD69)

__Note: You don't need any further confirmation after these two signals have been sent out (bearish engulfing and the Quasimodo), so you just sell at revisit or leave a limit order__. 

 Once the [structure](https://imgur.com/a/6NVAEDD) completes, it looks like a head and shoulder pattern, or whatever you may call it - the purpose of it is served.


This process can take a day or two to complete after price has entered your zone, but once finished - it's a satisfying sight and we have a happy trader at the finish line.

4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/5MPcgmm3/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/5MPcgmm3/)

For AUDUSD, I'd wait for price to come back down to that support on the 4 hour and retest that trendline.  


**EURAUD:**   
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/pQfNCRNZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pQfNCRNZ/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ow5UnayJ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ow5UnayJ/)

Might take a break out on EURAUD once it gets out of that mini trendline I drew on the 4 hour.  


**EURGBP:**   
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/BUu1Us2L/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BUu1Us2L/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/AdzoyhZI/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/AdzoyhZI/)

EURGBP approaching what could turn out to be support on the 4 hour, we'll have to wait and see if it breaks. I'm not really looking for anything from this pair right now.  


**EURJPY:**   
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/R1Us5xWG/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/R1Us5xWG/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Kbi1aci0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Kbi1aci0/) 

Could take a break and retest on some of the minor levels on EURJPY. Price has broken above the zone but there are some other upcoming resistance levels that might give us a problem if we tried to go for a break out trade or retest of that zone.  


**EURNZD:**   
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/jIDn7sCc/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/jIDn7sCc/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/w4JoOsdb/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/w4JoOsdb/) 

Waiting for EURNZD to come back down to the zone and retest the broken trendline for a trade.  


**EURUSD:**

4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/EaYV8uEq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EaYV8uEq/)

EURUSD currently chilling in the middle of nowhere. I want to see it reject those two intersecting trendlines for a long.  


**GBPCHF:**  
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/P8ZQBNIq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/P8ZQBNIq/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/XIXu9UFT/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XIXu9UFT/)

4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/P9JW5dDj/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/P9JW5dDj/)

Not comfortable with trying anything on GBPJPY currently.  


**GBPNZD:**

4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/K2X7unjG/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/K2X7unjG/)

GBPNZD has upcoming minor resistances so I wouldn't take any trades on it.  


**GBPUSD:**  
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/LwOlgDcO/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/LwOlgDcO/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/xFfkzinU/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xFfkzinU/)

GBPUSD might do another retest of that level and could provide a nice trade if it also lines up with the trendline.  


**NZDUSD:**  
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/drN5J1G8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/drN5J1G8/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/9n3FemMH/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9n3FemMH/)

I'm waiting for a break out to the downside on NZDUSD but the other trendline I drew might be in the way.  


**USDCAD:**  
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/DAuqoFuq/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DAuqoFuq/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/4KRPHZXw/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/4KRPHZXw/) 

USDCAD would be perfect for a breakout and a retest with plenty of space to take a trade on the 4 hour if it keeps going down for a bit before breaking upwards.  


**USDCHF:**  
DAILY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/aOcvqnOT/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aOcvqnOT/)  
4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ntXnpnjM/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ntXnpnjM/) 

USDCHF has already broken out of the trendline and it looks like it could keep going without us.  


**USDJPY:**  
WEEKLY: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/1sbbMgAc/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1sbbMgAc/)

4 HOUR: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ae6ON6ix/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ae6ON6ix/)

USDJPY has also started moving and would've provided a nice trade had I seen it earlier but we might get a chance for an entry if it comes down and rejects the area or trendline. I might set a limit order like this: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/f7wHSkun/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/f7wHSkun/)

### Week: 15-19.02.2021

## Key event: GBP. PMI

**Indicator of the economic situation in the UK services sector. It captures an overview of the condition of sales and employment. Any reading above 50 signals expansion, while a reading under 50 shows contraction.**

**We expect a similar reading to the previous month.**

**We do not expect this announcement to be relevant for the behavior of the GBP against other currencies during the week. More likely the technicals will be predominant. Only a very unexpected final data would affect the price action.**

## Key Levels:

* **Resistance 1.3900, 1.3950**
* **Support 1.3750**

## Trend GBP/USD:

**Bullish**

**Price broke last week the 1.3750 resistance and closed with an important bullish candle. It is heading now towards the next resistance levels.**

## Call to Action/Trade Idea

**We will look for any opportunity to join the bullish trend with a target on the next resistance levels. The previous resistance level is now important support.**

Currency:- GbpNZd  


Timeframe:- Daily  


Trade idea:- I'm looking for a long position.

The market has broken the trend line and also holds this. For next week if the market closes above 1.9250 with bullish pressure and prints any bullish price action signal then go for a long position.  
target will be the next resistance level which is 1.9600, 1.9800.

**Strategy**

1. Fibonacci is the main strategy, don't switch it up.
2. Only Trade in High Volume Times, Pre London/NY, and Open Asain/London/NY sessions. 
3. Never stop backtesting.

**Risk Management** 

1. 1-3% Risk per Trade.
2. Max Percentage of Trades that can be opened at the same time are %4.
3. If I lose %4 of account capital then no more trading but if I stay under %4 but get three losses, Im done trading for the day come back tomorrow.  

**Other Rules**  

1. Don’t take any signal services or anybody else’s trades. Don’t be a retail sheep. 
2. Stick to one trading Plan no switching master the Fibonacci. “I fear not the man who practiced 1000 kicks but the person who practiced one kick 1000 times” Bruce Lee. 
3. Always Journal your trades for self-reflection and optimizing to see your mistakes.
4. Don’t come to trading with a big EGO the markets will humble you always stick to risk management.
5. You only lost when you quit trading forex completely never quit.
6. Control your emotions you will have losing days but don’t let it define you as a trader.","self","https://redd.it/ljv7kr"

We all that in the same place when we start trading forex, we try a bunch of indicators, try buying and selling randomly, trying new strategies with indicators and then you find out that they lag so you stop using them, then you move from demo to live for the first time hoping your strategy works somehow and you lose ect ect ect.

I've through all of that, 5 years later I've been solely been focusing in price action with recent support and resistance. I have a risk management plan where if my trade goes in loss I cut 50% of my loss so I lose less or if it goes in profit I take 50% and let the rest run in BE.

I've been mainly been doing this as a scalp during NY open when the volume kicks in but something is not right.

I follow this person called Wicksdonlie on YouTube and almost every single day he is able to get a trade in a specific par therefore my aim is also try to get at least 1 trade per day but every single time my trade goes in negative.

Sometimes I look on the 30M tf for the entry but he looks on the 15M and enters, sometimes he only looks on the 30m and not on the 15M even if it's clear price action.

Am I missing something? I'm not new to this because I've been trying this for almost 3 years now and it nothing has changed.

They say it comes with time and market experience but so far I haven't seen any progression in my trading.

I have tried hours and hours in a simulation practicing and no progress. 


Does anyone have a trading style like mine? Are you able to get consistent? What am I missing? Have you had a similar experience?

First of all, I really appreciate your comments on my lats post : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/lii286/a\_trader\_will\_always\_have\_hope/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/lii286/a_trader_will_always_have_hope/)

Thank to all your comments and direct messages...

So let's begin...  
Let me start introducing myself...I'm from Peru (yes, my native language is Spanish, sorry for my grammar)... I'm an Industrial engineer, and my fields are insurances and I actually work for a company managing all its insurances... Additionally, on 2019 my partner and I started a company to distribute  biodegradable packaging. We invested around 50K USD (we imported a 40HQ container)... We weren't going very well... then the pandemic started and all our clients closed, so we stopped selling our products... We were desperate and we decided to import surgical mask (our provider in China was able to sell us those mask, so we started the quotation process)... When we were making our budget, a friend recommended us a person who was importing those mask in a higer volume, and he also told us that he was a founder of an Nonprofit Organization... So we decided to talk with him, (let's call him Robin because his name will appear many times in my story...). Robin told us that he could import the mask in less than one week (our time was 15 - 20 days), about the cost, he had the same cost we got, so we decided to work with him....

Unfortunately, the mask never arrived and we already payed around 33K USD... Can you imagine from where I get that amount of money?... 

Well, I'm finishing this part of the story trying you to guess... And also giving you an additional information about this part of the story... We hired a lawyer 3 months later and on the 4th month I got COVID....

The sample size is around 400 trades over a four year period. Does it look good to you? It's going up, the expectancy is positive, the profit factor is decent, the frequency is a bit to the low size but it's traded on the daily chart so it's to be expected. I should be happy then, right?

The testing started in January of 2017. But that's a random starting point, so what if you started trading this system in 2018 and stopped at the end of the year? [This](https://imgur.com/KAuSkug) would be the result. You would have spent an entire year under your high water mark, in drawdown. If you were trading a prop firm's money, you would have not received a profit split for pretty much six months. That's canned beans, stale bread and a whole lot of doubt and insecurities for half a year. 

What if you started trading this system in 2020? [This](https://imgur.com/yCMzEkJ) would have been your performance. Looks more dead than my soul. 

The reason why I am not a profitable trader is because I haven't settled on a system yet. The irony is that have dozens of profitable systems. Seriously, if you're looking for a strategy that makes money, I can give you plenty of them. I've got trend following systems, mean reversion, high reward and low reward strategies. Chances are I have something that fits your personality. Yet, nothing fits mine.

I like to think of myself as someone who has a chance at this. I can follow a trading plan to the T, I never feel the temptation to revenge trade, overleverage, deviate from my plan. I am good at thinking in probabilities, I am not seeking large gains, and every single decision I make in the market is backed by lenghty historical testing. There is no arrogance in saying that I am above the vast majority of people who try this industry - and despite this, I am still nowhere, after three years of devoting my entire life at this. 

The truth is that every equity curve looks like this. All of the tested systems I mentioned follow a similar story, and this is the reason I haven't settled for one yet. I thought it was because I just had to find a more optimized strategy, but the more I test, the more I am coming closer to a different conclusion: **this is just what edges look like**. 

Edges are small. Seriously small. Smaller than what I am probably comfortable with. And, maybe, after all, I am not cut for this. The amount of mental clarity, discipline and general happiness you need to be able to trade a system with such a tiny edge is out of reach for me. 

Trading made everything in my life secondary. This is a good thing, actually: my grades in college have skyrocketed simply because I see my exams as a distraction from my trading and I approach them with zero anxiety because I just don't care about them. My relationships have improved massively, because I see women and friends as a distraction from my trading, meaning that I just don't need to rely on anyone.

However, trading has also become my only thought. It's the only thing that drives my days. Since I am not successful at it, this also means I am an unhappy husk all of the time. 

And the worst thing is that I cannot quit. After seeing the potential lifestyle trading can give you, I cannot accept spending my life as a wage slave. And I am not talking about trading on a beach sipping cocktails: I am talking about having no hours, no boss besides your investors, and a lot more freedom. I can't give that up, even if it makes me unhappy.

Truth is, if I could go back, I would have never started. My friends and family torment me every day asking me to teach them how to trade, and I categorically refuse to do so because I don't want them to get hooked as well.

Hi I'm very new to forex and have been recommended this site. They claim to be an auto trading forex broker. You deposit your own money and real traders trade for you. So I thought that it would be amazing as I know nothing of forex. I opened an account and deposited $2000 and will be waiting 1 week to pull profits and I guess find out if this is real or fake. 

Does anyone else have any experience with this broker? I'm still suspicious of it but I don't know what to do.","self","https://redd.it/lkjoaz"

Do all these terms mean the same thing? I have been looking online and watching youtube videos to try and get my brain around these concepts, but it still seems unclear to me.   
Am I correct in assuming this mean:

Smart money invests a certain xx amount of currency to go long or short and buy/sell out all the stop and limit orders in a key area to drive the price higher/lower. Then once it breaks through, they execute a massive market order at the reduced price and drive the price in the opposite direction.   


I don't understand how it is worth the cost to drive the price down then just make it go the other way when its less liquid and market order easily spikes it up anyways.   


I'm not sure if my question makes sense, but its still really confusing to me.","self","https://redd.it/lknsma"

Kind of. I'm making more winning trades than loosing trades. 

Roughly my risk/reward system is:

* Risk = 2% (of margin)
   * Stop loss 1: 1% of margin (2.5 ATR)
   * Stop loss 2: 1% of marign (2.5 ATR)
* Reward: >= 0.4%
   * Take profit 1: 0.4% of margin (1 ATR)
   * The other just rides the trend until I get an exit signal

My one big stop-loss with DE10YB/EUR - (which I'm no longer trading). The smaller stop-losses I thought I had set to break even, but it came out at -$5. (I set the stop loss to break-even once the trade hits 1 ATR).

I have 9 good trades to 1 really bad trade and 5 break-even-ish trades. Total realised profit: -$61

I have 2.4K unrealised profit of open trades riding the trends (all with break-even stop-losses).

**I guess I just wanted to sanity check my system, because everywhere I hear that we should have a positive risk:reward ratio. What do you think ? Have I just been lucky so far ?**

I've opened a second practice account where I'm valuing 1 ATR = 1% of account, so a bad trade would loose 5% and a good trade would take 1%, then hopefully carry on running. (I'm probably just being greedy).

Here's a table of my transactions sorted by profit.

First, I want to tell you why I'm writing my story... first of all, I realized that it helped me a lot with my emotional state, I really feel bad about everything, I'm also looking for a  psychologist, mean while, I prefer writing it all here so I can organize my ideas before talking with a professional.

On my last post I didn't tell you from where I got the money....

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/lk6x4d/how\_i\_started\_trading\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/lk6x4d/how_i_started_trading_part_1/)

&#x200B;

Additionally, I'd like to set you a timeline, so you can get a better understanding...  


March 15th ....  quarantine stars on Peru

March 30th ... Got quotation from china and ""Robin""

 April 2nd ... Signed the contract and made the payment (33K USD)

April 6th... Mask should have arrived

April 15th... Robin told us that his ""partner""  **defrauded** him and never  brought  the masks.

&#x200B;

From where was the money?.... My girlfriend's father... She helped me to convince him....She also didn't didn't trust on the businesses we were doing; however, she had to trust me....

When we realized that the mask will never come.... we had to cancel all our clients (yes, we have already sell 80% of the mask without having them...)

Also I had to talk with my GF's father... However, when I told her about our ""problem"", she told me to NOT TELLING her father anything (yes my friends, girls always lie, remember that).... She argued that her father is too old and that kind of ""news"" will affect his heart and something bad could happen to him... So, I decided not to tell anything.... We were ""negotiating"" with ""Robin"" all the month (April), because he told us that he was looking a way to recover our money.

During April and May we were looking for clients for our company, because some new restaurants (our main market)  started to open. Additionally, we used our list of contacts to find other business who sell mask and try to re-sell that product, we did kind of well there,and we could get some incomes. Additionally, we invested on face shields; however, we couldn't sell most of them, we also bought material in order to produce those face shields, but we had some problems with the factory and we had to stop that project, anyway we invested around 7K USD.

Additionally, on those days (April and May), we've been working with a partner with whom we had a project about water disinfection (If you want in another post I will tell you about this).  We were working as brokers, we had to look for clients and join them with sellers.... We invested 0 dollars; however, we spent a lot of time and we have NO incomes at all.... I skipped when I realized it was a loss of time.

One of the members of that team introduced to us a lawyer (let's call him ""Dave""), we told him our story and he told us to that he can manage our case; however, my partner also had a recommended layer, in this occasion I trusted more on Dave; we started working with him, sending all the documents and paying the ""rates"" of the paperwork.... And guess what?....

On next post I'll tell you the answer.... Additionally, I'll tell you how my partner started on trading and how I get involved without knowing anything about....

Analysis above did not play out as I did not expect such a big drop, yet still managed to find a setup to trade during NY session. Bias does remain bullish for me in the short term.

I have past experience trading Forex on Think or Swim and would consider myself an Intermediate trader. Despite it being moderately profitable other things in life took me away from it for the past 10 years.

I'm in the U.S. and still have TD acocunt but I'm not using it currently for any active investments. I have 30 years of software coding experience BUT I'm also short on free time due to a new business I started recently.

I'd like to in what free time I have left gently get back into FX trading. I'd like to use a platform that at least supports more trailing stop options, such as a trailing stop based on moving averages would be nice. I'd rather not have to code but if some quick simple coding is required, that's fine.

Should I stick with what I'm familiar with, Think Or Swim? And is it easy to create more complex trailing stop algos? Or should I switch to a broker that supports MetaTrader 5? The reason I say 5, is, there doesn't appear to be a huge downside to using 5 over 4 and would be nice to have the option to trade futures if desired in the future within one platform.","self","https://redd.it/lld48z"

I am new to Forex, but I am wondering can we trade Forex like trading stocks? Specifically, is it safe to use dollar cost averaging strategy in Forex? 

My strategy is as follows:

1) use daily, weekly chart to determine the overall trend

2) enter a starting trade in the direction of the trend

3)  then 
- if it goes against you, you buy more when it dips. If you have sufficient funds to average down, you will win. 
- If it goes with you, you add more on the way up.





To use AUD/USD as an example, it has been consistently in the uptrend for the past year. If one started buying AUD/USD  since last summer, keep buying every time it dips or buy every week, and hold until now, he would have make a good fortune.  With this strategy and assume you ride the trend as long as possible, there is no way you can lose money, right?

So does anyone use this strategy? Or do most Forex traders trade short term, close their positions every few days?
I also read there is rollover fee for holding Forex over the weekend, but  I have no idea how much it costs. Is this fee to high that deters most Forex traders from  holding long term?","self","https://redd.it/lljhqk"

Suppose you're looking at the AUDUSD chart and everything is lining up for the perfect buy signal. The price has just bounced off a strong support line, there's a great looking green candle, etc. Everything says it's about to go up. So you buy. 

However, at the exact same time on the AUDJPY chart, it might look the complete opposite. the AUD has just hit a huge line of resistance, suggesting that you sell. 

Now as far as I understand (and maybe this is where I'm going wrong).. all of these currencies are connected and must stay in sync with eachother. So if the price of AUD starts going down on the AUDJPY chart, and the JPYUSD chart remains steady.. then AUD must also go down on AUDUSD chart. Is this right?

If so, so how can technical analysis possibly work then? You can spend all day analysing AUDUSD and decide it's a great buy... but the price of AUD is also going to be affected by the charts of every other AUD currency pair, like AUDJPY, AUDEUR, etc...

Do we need to analyse every AUD currency pair and wait until the vast majority of them say buy? If not, what am I missing?","self","https://redd.it/lllhyl"

First, thanks for reading me, I know that it's not a story for the Nobel.... However, I'm writing this because it is helping me to release my feeling and the bad emotions I've been dealing with....

Well, lets continue...

On the previous story...[https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/lkwxc6/how\_i\_started\_trading\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/lkwxc6/how_i_started_trading_part_2/)

What happened with our lawyer?... He wasn't a real Lawyer... When I searched his educational information, he hasn't studied law anywhere.... And he did a terrible work...  He presented the sue in a wrong place on August (remember we approached to him on May)... When he confirmed us that he presented the sue, we tried to get more information about our case; however, he never gave us an answer. On September we decided to change our lawyer, and the new one did his work and found our sue and could re-send it to the correct place; however, it took until last month to arrive to the correct place.

Meanwhile, we were looking for ways to earn money, and may partner too. A friend of him was on the ""Forex world"" and told my partner about a plan where he manage accounts and get around a 10% of monthly profit. That was the first time we heard about forex... 

My partner convinced his father to invest on Forex with his friend.... His father invested around 10K... and that guy loss all the money in two month... The guy returned 70% of the capital.... 

Then we met another guy from the Broker, and he offered a program with Gold, with 20%-40% monthly profit and weekly withdraws... We decided to work with him... I used my credit card to invest 20K... The first week they did 0%... the next one, they did around 15%... the week after that they did -100%, yes, they lost all our money. However, we had a contract and they had to return us the 50%... The haven't done yet because they lost the money of all their clients... (around 100K USD). We know that they are working on a project about Bitcoin mining... they asked us for some time... We have nothing else to do, so we are waiting...

Then we approached a little bit to the broker, and decided to invest and manage our own account... I started with $400, and made around 2K USD in one month.... I was doing very well... My partner tried to join and help me and we lose all.... And invested again... We have spent around 6K with any good results... I'm feeling more and more tired... I stooped trading, my partner  bought  a signal group... That group was going well... for one day... then my partner lose around 3K on Gold... I remember that day because he called me on midnight crying... I tried to help him... But I think I do it worst and lose 1.5K when I could have won 3K.... After that, we were desperate to recover all our money... But we failed day by day.... 

That was our worst day...

[What's up guys! As you can see,  GBPJPY has been moving parabolic these past few weeks as it had broken a weekly downtrend trendline to the upside.  GBPJPY has been respecting smaller timeframe levels on the 1 hour and continues to creep up; however, I believe that there will be some downwards pressure in the zone we are in right now. GBPJPY is effectively attempting for form equal highs with the tops of the two candles we saw peaked in December 2019. The strong move into this zone of resistance along with the form of a  double top and multiple gaps to be filled from this parabolic movement has me convinced that we will see some intense selling pressure here. You can see that the weekly candle is already starting to wick near those previous highs and we have seen some down movement on the 1 and 4 hour timeframes already. On the fundamental side, there is more news circulating that the new UK Covid-19 strain may actually be more lethal than we originally anticipated, so this may serve as a catalyst to push down GBP pairs. I am already in a sell position that I entered at 147.517 and will be targeting 142.338 for 518 pips in order to maintain a 1:3 risk to reward ratio. I am also looking to enter another position if GJ pushes up to 147.965 since we also see heavy rejection far to the left around that zone and my stop loss for both positions will be around 149.261. If my second position is activated I will look to either peel partials or close that position around 144.277 for around a 365 pip gain while I let the other position run to my 142.338 target. Either way, there is at the very least 300-500 pips to be gained from this play and I am willing to hold for a week or more. I believe  GBPJPY has to retest the zone around 141.611 that was previous weekly resistance it broke out of, so my targets are set before that area.](https://preview.redd.it/xrkt2t8400i61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e611d13958eda61e7d073feb7e80689f5ea46ee)","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/OhEnStmVAQpd48qUXSdYsmx7drG1kwv3ctEZmwX1b2E.jpg","https://redd.it/llppt5"

So for example/6B is British Pound trading against the dollar. So that'd be the same as GBP/USD spot.

So why, when I compare the DX (US Dollar Index Futures) to 6B (British Pound Futures) do I get this:

&#x200B;

[1 hour chart ](https://preview.redd.it/omyysszj70i61.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba0974855e37406970b41b42efc98e14ba4a27b1)

I get a complete inverse correlation. And in fact, when I back test this...it even seems like an AMAZING indicator.

Dollar goes down....GBP goes up (vice versa) this seems to be the case with EVERY currency vs the US Dollar using this comparison.

In fact, if you just wait for at least a 2% discrepancy in the separation between these two assets and it'd be really reliable.

For example, take the two areas I've circled here:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cjfwpqg080i61.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac2b6babe0f6f8c2058fea0f183e167a7d339d7e

Those circles are around the September 25th, 2020.

If I go back and look at GBP Futures individually on that date I can see this:

&#x200B;

[1 hour GBP](https://preview.redd.it/muc11f7e80i61.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=6819f23b34a47a6a8d2f305f97843f012de75b56)

If I were looking at the comparison from before I could put myself on a long-bias and maybe I'd look to take a long around here and as you can see it would have worked out really well.

One contract up to that previous area of resistance would have made a little over $4,700.

And look at the US Dollar Index from that same period...

&#x200B;

[1 hour US Dollar Index](https://preview.redd.it/w5runieu80i61.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50ec9329aad4438fb6eb7fc075d43fcb3a9f696)

If you took a short at the same time on the US Dollar Index to that previous area of support, you could have made about $2,500 for one contract -- so combined on both legs about $7,200.

All in all - to go short the dollar and long the GBP is -- in effect -- you're buying GBP/USD spread. It would be the SAME thing as going long the GBP/USD spread.

**BUT!!** Aren't the GBP Futures effectively ALREADY a spread against the USD? They are -- after all -- trading against the US Dollar...right?

So why does a comparison chart on these set up a perfect Dollar vs British Pound spread trade?

To figure this out, I compared the GBP/USD spread to British Pound Futures....and as you might have guessed **they are 100% correlated.** They are SO correlated that it's pointless showing you a chart because it just looks like one line (rather than two).

BUT -- if I create my own chart in Trading view of ""6B1!/DX1!"" and compare it to 6B (British Pound Futures) by itself there IS a clear discrepancy.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cgt6eyd7a0i61.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbebb288e8e606ec6273db2483fc7d41abd71860

As you can see -- even though TECHNICALLY British Pound futures is the same as GBP/USD (which when compared, has a 100% correlation) and creating a spread of 6B/DX (British Pound Futures vs the US DOllar Index) are essentially ALL THE SAME THING....one is up 11% since November, the other is only up 7.5%.

WTF?!

So what happens if I add JUST the US Dollar Index Futures to this chart as well?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0lcum32oa0i61.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad7549cbafb2e139bd4595c3d2dc322162fa3cd8

You can see the same inverse correlation.

**This is confusing the CRAP out of me.**

On the surface, it seems like a good trade to -- for example -- buy the US Dollar Futures and sell the British Pound Futures when they get too stretched out and look for that correlation to then inverse (as I showed at the beginning of this post).

But that would be essentially NO different from going short the GBP/USD spread...which is essentially the same as SELLING the British Futures contract outright (You're betting the British Pound will go down against the US Dollar if you do that).

But that's not the case.

Because if you were to take a spread on these two contracts individually (buy one, sell the other) you'd actually make a lot more money because they are clearly negatively correlated and when one goes up, the other goes down.

So how is this possible?","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/9nPzgWoApyavmDnBs6LavRwvmX8m0FcxYl-xQ-E9uXM.jpg","https://redd.it/llql83"

I trade price structure and nature, utilising patterns to gain a profit. Structure first, candlesticks secondary.

In this [4 hour timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com/x/r75G5sxU/) I see an ascending channel (which when completed means price will move to the downside) We have two clear touches and on the third we broke above correctively (how price breaks trend lines is important if it was impulsively this trade would be different) at the top before the reverse we see a nice tweezer top formation which in this key area is very valuable.

On the [one hour timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2Mgg8spp/) as I was looking for a trade there didn't seem to be a clear entry however moves to the downside in this type of scenario often there is a clearer structure on a lower timeframe to look for an entry. The entry is the first step, knowing how and why you are getting into a trade and being more precise and confident into the trades you take. In this snapshot you can see below my entry a small flag formed, this would also make a good entry had I missed the first one. There are always opportunities in the market, be careful not to force them though!

The [15 minute timeframe](https://www.tradingview.com/x/XaZ4RwcG/) which I use only for entries rather than analysis to be more precise in said entries, shows a correction after an impulse so I take the entry below said correction, stop loss above for the sell. I personally don't use stop losses smaller than 15pips. The current take profit marked is where I have my current stop loss after it moved in my direction.

Managing this trade. Using the one hour chart I will monitor to see how price action behaves, more specifically in key areas, previous lows etc. I do not focus on support or resistances. The further away from the top of the structure we get, the larger the corrections usually become which I will not hold this trade if that happens in case any volatility takes me out of the trade before dropping further. If price does continue to move down and break the pattern as seen on the 4 hour chart I will look for a re-entry if the market provides it. Even if price moves all the way down, if I do not see a clear entry that fits my plan I will not take the trade. Currently locked in just over 2% on this trade, running at currently 4%.

Let me know if you found this insightful in anyway and if you'd like me to post further breakdowns of how I trade and other trades I take :)","self","https://redd.it/lm1q1d"

Australian data is showing more signs of pushing the Aussie dollar around when we get a good surprise. Employment is a key metric for the Aussy as the RBA is watching it! Last time we really didn't get that much of a deviation, with just -0.1 in Unemployment creating a small 4 pip move. Not enough to trade but does show that the Aussie is sensitive to a deviation. 

Check out the move here...

We must consider the 3 main lines in any trading decision,

Employment = The headline number of how many jobs are gained or lost.   
Full Time = How many of those jobs are Full-time positions, as opposed to Part-Time. This is important as a big positive surprise in Employment number may look good initially, but if it's made up of many Part-time positions, well that's not good at all!   
Unemployment= This line is important! The RBA is watching this line specifically and will be key to any trade's success! 

This month the forecast ranges are tighter than normal, so that helps if our triggers are hit! Trade Plan...

one day (feb, 10, 2021) a guy named Daniel Savage approached me through Instagram (insta name: danielprofitsavage) and asked me to send him 0.008btc (320$) for forex trading. He promised to me that he had a 100% successful plan to gain more money like 14000-1800$ in 10 business days. He would only receive 15% of my profits after every withdrawal. He sent photos of his trading business so I said why not? And I accepted. I sent him 0.008BTC.

After that he sent me to his CEO to communicate with him through whatsup. I asked them a lot of times if I needed to know something more about the whole procedure but they told me to calm down and everything is fine. Thursday feb 11 started a trading account in [tradersiqsignals.com](http://tradersiqsignals.com/).

After six days my account had 10500$. They told me in 7 days ( feb 18)  I would be able to make my first withdrawal.

Yesterday they told me that tomorrow I would be able to make withdrawals. They also told me that I must first send firstly the 15% (1600$) fee and then I could withdraw my profits.

I told them that I was supposed to give the 15% after the withdrawal. I don’t have such a large amount of money of course. I gave them three options a) they allow me to withdraw my profits and then I’ll pay the fee, b). I'll send my email and my password to Daniel in order to have access to my trading account with 10k, so he could claim the fees for himself, and c) they would give me a full refund of my 0.008.

After long conversations (which I had n screenshots) with both of them told me than none of my options are feasible for them and I would lose my trading account if I don’t deposit until today (he also told me idiot, dump, and dump ass nigga.

Please help me. Is there a solution to all this? Could I do something to get my btc back? Can I denounce him somewhere for forex scam and fraud?","self","https://redd.it/lmkn5b"

I've gone to casinos, drunk, and only risked a very limited amount of capital, with no exceptions.

But I revenge trade. And they say it's a form of gambling - and it absolutely is. In the end, you enter with no edge on something that will either win or lose money for you.

&#x200B;

But something just does not make sense. If I'm not a gambler, why do I gamble in forex?

&#x200B;

Happened this week. I lost 20R on 2 positions. I entered 12 times. Shorting eurjpy all NY session on the 16th, with a strong belief it will go down. There was no real analysis, just anger.

And then it hit me. It wasn't the money. Not at all. It wasn't really ego either, as mine is shoved under the rug with all the rest of the garbage. It's been 8 years and still in questionable profit, so not exactly high in spirits there. Kinda used to it at this point.

&#x200B;

No, it wasn't any of that.

It was stress adiction.

It felt good? I can't explain it, but I used that exact moment to do an exercise - sit down and write the first blob that comes to mind, with no censure, until you fill a whole page (or even more).

**And that is how I found I have a very strong belief that trading has to be stressful. That I should be feeling pain.** 

And that is the way it has to go. That discovery was reconfirmed, when I let this happen the next day That is the 5m chart on WTI. I caught that monster move, and then didn't take profit. I even scaled in, resulting in a net double loss. I had this notion that the market should go further down, and I was already into a lot of stress (had floating 4R!) and instead of scaling out, I even scaled in. Twice!

Breaking every rule in my book.

&#x200B;

How do I reset that? How do I stray away from those old, terrible thoughts. How do I stop pressuring myself?

All above should be my ""a-ha"" moment, when everything turns. But if you've ever traded real money, there is a huge gap between knowing how something should work, and actually doing it.

It is quite surprising that the forex market has remained relatively stable as compared to the other markets. The main currencies driving this market are Euro and USD and most of the traders ask for the forex tips to maximize profits. Although there is a lot of uncertainty about how the forex market will respond further after this global pandemic, several reasons could lead to a profitable trade in this market.

**Here are 5 ways to boost the Forex market profitability via Forex Signals:**

**#1. Traders will Resort to Hedging**

Traders at this time want to limit the funds that they will lose in other markets. This will lead to multiple investments to earn greater profits from their strengthening assets. As the exchange rates fluctuate significantly, they want to lock exchange rates in the forex market using popular trading tips. So, the investors are following forex tips that will help them to hedge the investment.

**#2. More Investment in Safe Haven Assets**

Many traders are opting to trade in the forex market, particularly in safe-haven currencies, in order to earn more pips profits during these volatile market conditions. Although this strategy needs to be carefully monitored, so keep a close eye on **forex signals**.

While investing in such currencies, it is crucial to protect gains. A well-informed trader will set profit targets and use a trailing stop to ensure that their winning position is not converted into a loser position.

**#3. Increase in Inflation**

Countries deposit large quantities of reserves with central banks to maintain the stability of the economy. Banks usually invest these reserves in the forex market. During COVID-19, as a country’s economy sees a decline, the interest rates stand reduced, which causes a fall in exchange rates of currency.

As soon as the economy enters such a position, inflation rates will increase, increasing interest rates and rising demand for the currency. This leads to profit in forex trading of that currency.

**#4. Switching to Cryptocurrencies**

Higher volatility can sometimes ***lead to higher profits***. If rapid and profound falls in currencies in the forex market seem too small, you can switch to cryptocurrencies that are a lot more volatile and allow trading without weekend gaps.

**#5. Leverage**

***In forex trading, higher leverage leads to more significant profits***. So the investors who plan for higher conversion rates plan to take the risk.

**Final Word**

COVID-19 had a significant impact on financial markets. Therefore it is essential to monitor the risk management strategies employed by you during this pandemic. Such an approach should be in line to meet the challenging trading environment. If you invest wisely in this market and follow reliable Forex tips, it can turn your investments into profitable outcomes even during this time.","self","https://redd.it/lmm0ha"

1) Is there a way to see the order books?

That brings me to another question...if we can’t see the order book then:
2) How do you guys determine support levels and resistance levels? 
Kinda seems like everyone is just making up their own levels in a sense?

Also, while I’m at it
3) Is there a way to automatically enter a trade at a certain level? 

For example how we can preset a stop loss and take profit. Can we preset when to enter a trade? Like if I want to set one to enter at the middle of the night if a certain number hits? Or do I need to manually wake up and do it","self","https://redd.it/lmxpu7"

I'm planning of taking advantage of my age and I'm gonna invest in ETF's for the long term. With this being said, I just want to point out that I'm not a naive kid that thinks that forex is learned in a couple of weeks. I know to steer clear of everyone who shows their cars, trips, houses, etc; I see this as a way to achieve financial freedom, since I don't believe a 9 to 5 will do that for me.
Now, I'll be learning through babypips, but, if that's all it took to become a profitable trader, there'd be a whole lot more traders around. Keeping that in mind, where do I got after babypips? YouTube? And if so, who? Do I try to find a trustworthy mentor? And again, if so, who?
I'd also like to ask a few things while I'm at it. First of all, do you even recommend a 17 year old to start learning about the market? How profitable can one become? How many trades a day should you do to have a comfortable profit? 1? 2? 7?
I'm sure you get these types of questions all the time, and I'm sorry for asking them again, but I just feel like I gotta be very cautious about entering a market I know nothing about all by myself.

**Best trade:** [https://www.tradingview.com/x/aJYbrig3/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/aJYbrig3/) 3R

**What went well?**

\-I didn’t care, and let the trade play out

**What could've gone better?**

\-I was full of adrenaline, hopefully over time I will be more relaxed

**Worst trade:** No trade was bad 0R

I keep a “journal” of all my trades. I then evaluate them, both at the close, and at the end of the week. From this, I identified a weakness: scaling out too early.I had an issue of being able to catch pips with my system, but exiting too early. Below is an example of how catching pips != profit.

I'm very happy with this week, and truly thankful to u/Lowcarbcrate . His advice of set and forget, along with the confidence I gained from spending time backtesting my optimal RRR on the weekend, allowed me to make these gains this week. It’s early days, but I hope this post can serve as an example towards the benefits of evaluating your performance, and help myself and maybe just one other person progress in this venture.

I primarily trade EUR/USD but throw in USD/CAD and AUD/USD on occasion. 

I demo traded for around 6 months and then started live trading last year(close to a year of live trading). I tend to make more money when I'm a bear. I see things that line up with my plan, execute, and have good results. 

I love that I still learn new things on what seems to be a daily basis. When it comes to going long though... I'm not sure if it's my pessimism/wanting everything to crash and burn or what. I tend to miss any type of bullish signals. I just can't seem to stick with longs and feel confident in those trades. 

On some days, I'll take a look at things... if the trend isn't bearish, I just sit out. I still watch price action/the market/continue learning but I don't even worry too much about making money on those days.

AUD Fundamentals

 • The February Board meeting delivered an extension to the QE program, announcing an additional $AU100bn bond buying program when the current program expires in mid-April at the rate of $AU5bn per week. This news is delivered earlier than expected and constitutes a dovish surprise, which led the AUD underperform. 

• Through 2021, AUD should continue to trade high beta to risk-on/global growth developments. The expected wide scale rollout of a vaccine, our expectations for a reflationary 2021 and associated weaker dollar, therefore implies AUD appreciation. Aussie should be additionally supported by the continued strong","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Vi_WmHkrvJRhkG6BJmYWprb905gBIl49zE-t8W3PAeI.jpg","https://redd.it/lnrj4x"

I'm reading a book about Forex scalping just to get a feel for what it's like and if it's something I'd like to add to my trading.  In the book the author mentions that the strategy described aims for a 10 pip profit.  I started looking at what a 10 pip move looks like for the EUR/USD and 10 pips seems like a pretty big move for scalping.   Looking at the 1m chart 10 pips seems like a somewhat substantial move.  And takes a fair amount of time to complete(20-40 mins). Now don't get me wrong, 10 pips is no huge move but in regards to scalping it seems larger than I'd expect.  

Along with this the author claims that the average day on the EUR/USD sees about 150 pips of swing.  This doesn't seem to be the case when I look at recent history.  Most days seem to be around 80 pips(low to high). 

So I'm think maybe the reduction of spread has squished everything down a little.  Maybe 5 pips is more common for a scalping profit now.  But maybe I'm just very mis-calibrated.

What would you say is a common gain amount a scalper would be looking for? 

Thanks!","self","https://redd.it/lnvoc8"

I'm doing back-testing for my strategy. I trade 15min, my problem is that i only found two ways to test but it has some cons i need to figure out. 

option 1 FXblue simulator

option 2 trading view (using arrow to move bar by bar).

&#x200B;

option 1 problem, it does not save the chart with entries and TP/SL. this is simulator running on MT4

option 2 Chart only go back to 4months and it will remove the older data, so even if i back-test only 4 month, next month, 1 month of data will be lost. 

&#x200B;

Any decent way to backtest (free) ?

&#x200B;

Thanks","self","https://redd.it/lob1rv"

For example, when talking about calculating pips:

 

(The value change in counter currency) times the exchange rate ratio = pip value (in terms of the base currency)

**\[.0001 CAD\] x \[1 USD/1.0200 CAD\]**

Or simply as:

\[(.0001 ~~CAD~~) / (1.0200 ~~CAD~~)\] x 1 USD = 0.00009804 USD per unit traded

They just flipped the formula??? I got very confused.

When talking about transaction cost:

 

The critical characteristic of the bid/ask spread is that it is also the transaction cost for a round-turn trade.

**Round-turn** means a buy (or sell) trade and an offsetting sell (or buy) trade of the same size in the same currency pair.

just.... what???? 

I'm having a really hard time understanding any of this, so, if anyone could explain it to me, I'd be grateful.","self","https://redd.it/loqop7"

### Week: 22-26.02.2021

## Key event: NZD. Interest Rate Decision

**RBNZ Interest Rate Decision is announced by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. If the RBNZ is hawkish about the inflationary outlook of the economy and rises the interest rates it is positive, or bullish, for the NZD.**

**We expect a similar reading to the previous lecture: 0.25%**

**We do not expect this announcement to be relevant for the behavior of the NZD against other currencies during the week. More likely the technicals will be predominant. Only a very unexpected final data would affect the price action.**

## Key Levels:

* **Resistance 0.7320, 0.7400.**
* **Support 0.7150, 0.7000**

## Trend NZD/USD:

**Bullish**

**Price broke last week a tight indecision range and closed on the upper ranges close to a resistance level.**

## Call to Action/Trade Idea

**We will look for any opportunity to join the bullish trend with a target on next resistance levels. Previous resistance level is now an important support.**

To execute the same trade on etoro I need to put forward more than 10x what I'm prepared to lose, so even though my stop loss says that I won't lose more than £10 I need to put forward a couple of hundred.

Have I been practicing wrong the whole time or is etoro just a wee bit different to everything else? Is it possible to find a platform where I can execute a trade by only putting forward a couple of pounds?

I hope I can provide you more interesting approaches to the forex market.

Lets start with the result of the trade last week:

&#x200B;

[I wanted to see the price to retrace first so I can then be full engaged. Sadly it didn't so I was in with a starting position. Its funny to see how it went back touched my entry and went into profit again hahaha Anyways, good trade with small profit.](https://preview.redd.it/xdiuvcxpfui61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=3566a32f8a3d75623ef3b5e04d241447563e9a12)

&#x200B;

Today we gonna discuss a potential EUR/USD trade for the next week.

Lets start with the reasons we want to go long the euro.

We got a strong up move in the 10y Bond Yields for Euro Area countries. This indicates future inflation which emerges mostly because of expected economic growth.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f36cx5p2aui61.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e62c94fd14194aa1d40e0695198078b0c55d294

[This makes sense since we got relatively very good Flash PMI data in the euro area.](https://preview.redd.it/rbaswr5aaui61.png?width=2154&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33020cf3a53edb984a8de362aa0d48e2dd0fcab)

What is also interesting, the prices of insurances of a credit default of euro area countries fell very strong. Think of it as a residential building insurance against fire which is falling in price in a city were it always rains recently.

&#x200B;

[It gives us a good indicates what market participants think of the economic conditions in the euro area.](https://preview.redd.it/oee2fnv2bui61.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=162f86613ca9cc3f711f50c85104fbde5e70455a)

Now lets go over to the United States.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sli35zvgbui61.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbcd84a3d7ce8904ce783143ac321a2575d22d57

The US is one of a few countries which sees good numbers in PMI's Inflation etc. Usually we would like to go the US long for that, but why do we buy inflationary currencies at all? If it means that a currency loses its purchasing power because of inflation, surely we should sell it?

Rising inflation is good for a currency when the country’s central bank is credible and willing to raise rates in response to inflation. This applies to most G10 countries, most of the time. The same can be said of falling inflation—it is generally bad for currencies in developed nations because it allows the country’s central bank to cut rates. Lower interest rates usually mean a lower currency.

Rising inflation can be bad for a country if the market perceives that the central bank is behind the curve and will not respond fast enough with interest rate hikes. This is because lower real rates (real rate = nominal interest rate minus inflation) mean a loss of purchasing power and potential loss of value for the country’s currency. At the same time, falling inflation or deflation can be good for a currency if the central bank of that country is perceived to be impotent or unwilling to act. This was the case in Japan until the deflation/strong currency link was broken by Abenomics in 2012.

&#x200B;

Now lets find out which levels might be interesting for EUR/USD long.

[The edge of 1 positive standard deviation with a high volume of calls might be a strong but reachable resistance for the price to move up.](https://preview.redd.it/0j5bse26kui61.png?width=2333&format=png&auto=webp&s=beb1b171d75b6f2e248cc522a2b653383226ba6d)

[We are currently at a fair price. We want to profit from the upper edge of the price volume we see on the left. Our SL is on the volume low.](https://preview.redd.it/1qoj63f0fui61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=f38e8fead6fe0ea2567654d88c327e2b6bbdc2bc)

**RISK TO THE TRADE:**

\- We get bad inflation data for the Euro Area on Tuesday

\- Powell speaks more neutral than expected on Tuesday

**This is for education purpose only and not meant to encourage imitation.**

My focus for this week is aud/usd and usd/cad. AUD has been rising and I have been enjoying the ride, I plan on still holding eur/aud shorts and aud/jpy buys, for now I am interested in buying aud/usd and selling usd/cad. I have not touched USD due to rising yields and short squeezes happening, but now I believe our friend USD is ready to continue its downtrend. With the feds coming out and still striking that dovish tone, they don't plan on tapering ANY asset purchases anytime soon and with their 2% inflation goal (some voters want %3) still far fetched, USD is still very much bearish! I do not expect to buy USD in till around summer time this year as that is when vaccines should be rolled out to more Americans and more businesses open (we must remember US is the largest economy and many investors know this, so buying into the debt is what we should expect as US will make a comeback medium term especially with a democratic controlled senate)  Another big reason for USD weakness is the 1.9 Trillion dollar package that is soon to be voted this week, if this passes it will send USD straight to hell! so keep your eye on this! For my friend CAD, with rising oil prices there should be more CAD buy interest (remember oil is our biggest business and yes I am canadian!) HOWEVER, due to the biden administration cancelling the keystone pipeline this does hurt the CAD currency. So I am interested in selling usd/cad STRICKLY for USD weakness, Rising oil prices will help lift CAD as long as OPEC does not shoot out more supply AND with vaccines rolling out there should be more demand for OIL and thus CAD looks good to buy. Meanwhile RBA still stands by their bond purchasing and still want to keep the 3 year yield curve at 0.1% as well as governor Lowe expecting a much stronger recovery for this year. Therefore AUD/USD looks good to buy, however I would like to wait for price to pull back to 0.78012 area, Happy pip hunting!

My question is in order for btc or the Dow to keep going high what needs to happen. 

Is it required thay more buyers come in to the market?

Or is it that there are not enough sellers?

My understanding is price will go higher to encourage selling and does not require new buyers but am I correct? 

My next question is for markets that go all time high is it possible to identify true support and resistance levels or do they just become temporary S and R?","self","https://redd.it/lpco30"

Europe has showed signs of changing sentiment, with flash GDP only contracting 0.6% against estimates of a 0.7% decline. Similarly, The German ZEW Sentiment report indicated that optimism amongst investors had climbed 9.4 points for February. German Flash Manufacturing PMI data indicated the sector hit a 36-month high in February surging to 60.6%. The UK economy saw a 0.7% rise in prices for January compared with the previous year. Recreation and culture represented the largest contributors to the rise, with apparel creating a drag on the index. Retail sales in January were abysmal; contracting by 8.2% when compared with the previous month as lockdown restrictions continue to weigh on growth. 

Unemployment claims in the US unexpectedly rose last week with 861,000 applications for jobless support registered. The spike comes after a few weeks of declining claims, underscoring the scale of economic dislocation. Retail sales offered a glimmer of hope for the economy, rising for the first time in three months and representing a 7-month high at 5.3%. The spike in sales has been attributed to the issuance of stimulus checks. According to the HIS Markit report, output in the U.S. accelerated at the fastest pace in 6 years in February. The rise has been attributed to climbing domestic demand and rising new orders for the Manufacturing sector. 

Japan’s economic growth registered 3% for the fourth quarter of 2020, beating estimates and indicating that there is room for optimism for the third largest global economy. A rise in exports and consumer spending were growth catalysts. Exports to China climbed over 37% in January year-to-date. Output in the manufacturing sector continues to weigh on the economy, however, as February’s Jibun PMI report indicated another contraction for the sector at 47.6 points.","self","https://redd.it/lpe6st"

My current strategy has been using a mix of the MA crossover (5,10) in longer time frames whilst using Bollinger bands in a smaller time frame to find entry, this has worked well using the 1H & 4H TF's, but as it is my own construction it's rough around the edges.

Does anyone know of any YT's that have videos using either of these two in their strategy?

After completing Babypips I realised I prefer sticking to 1H-4H timeframes (not too fast, not too slow) and using MA and Bollinger Bands as I find these indicators easy to read and even with it giving entry late there's often still plenty of movement for my Risk Management.","self","https://redd.it/lprgqz"

The attached graph plots the GBP - USD 10year bond yield difference Vs the GBPUSD closing price, on a daily time-frame from Feb 2017 - Feb 2021.

The green box highlights the first significant correlation. The bond yield difference reduced, then months later the GBPUSD price also came down in value.

The red box highlights the second significant correlation. The bond yield started to increase, and then months later the GBPUSD started to increase.

Currently, the bond yield has been ranging a little bit, whilst the GBPUSD is continuing it's uptrend.

**Currency pairs:-** UsdJpy

**Time frame**:- H4

**Trade ideas**:- I'm looking for a Long opportunity. 

The market has broken the previous resistance level which is 104.50 and turned it into a support level. 104.50 is also a higher low swing level.

If the market holds this level and prints any bullish candlestick signal above this 104.50 level then go for Long.

The target will be the next resistance level which is 106.20 and set the stop loss at 103.80.

Hi would this theoretically be possible or would I run into a lot of problems ?

Was looking to hedge positions with around a 10 -15 pip TP and a 1-3 Pip SL. Because normally NFP shoots in a certain direction regardless of of wether it’s good or bad news. 

Was going to place trades 1 minute before NFP is released.

**EurUsd Trade Idea**

**Currency pairs**:- EurUsd

**Timeframe:**\- H4

**Trade idea**:- The market has appeared inverse head and shoulders pattern. Now tomorrow if the market break this resistance level or neckline which is 1.2160 and after breakout just retests this level and prints any bullish candlestick signal we will go for Long.

The target will be the next support level which is 1.2335 and set the stop loss at 1.2100.

Basically I would like to invest more in short term volatile stocks, but work prevents that. I did pretty well doing it in college when I had time but I no longer do so I’m drawn to the 24 hr possibilities in the forex market. I know this is a whole different game and I’m excited to try to figure it out with a demo account. But before I start, does anyone have enough success to make it worth while with limited time available in non ideal times? If I started with say $1,000 could I realistically make it worth my time? I’m looking to learn about new investment opportunities, make a little side money, and hopefully have some fun with it. Then buy a couple sports cars of course. But like I said If I can only do it early like 5:30am-7am CST or late after 5:30 is it worth it? Has anyone had good success in a similar situation?","self","https://redd.it/lq3pbo"

Signal Description :

127.30 Looks like there should be some good support as the overall bullish trend remains in place.

As we approach month-end there should also be some Jpy selling across the board.

Look to buy here at 127.50 with SL well below the mentioned level and see if we can catch a move above 130

Anyway New Zealand is doing quite well when it comes to battling COVID and most of its data has been very positive. Thus the central bank is expected to be hawkish. They had talked about negative rates like the UK but there is a possibility they will be in no rush for that. Even NZIER shadow board that follows RBNZ but independent from the central bank think with the current positive data New Zealand is on the road to recovery. Get the info here : [https://nzier.org.nz/publication/nziers-shadow-board-sees-little-need-for-further-stimulus](https://nzier.org.nz/publication/nziers-shadow-board-sees-little-need-for-further-stimulus)

So the pairs i see that will bring the best yield is GBP/NZD and AUD/NZD since both are overbought in the H4 region. I expect further sell off of the pairs mentioned heading to RBNZ and more sell off if the central bank sounds positive. I will be in the trade with 10 lots sell on GBP/NZD pair. So good luck.

If the market after retest holds this Support area which is 1.40000 and prints any Bullish Candlestick Signal then go for Long.

The target will be the next Resistance level which is 1.4200 and Stoploss Set at 1.3900.

I was expecting a retracement over the last week, but the Fed's dovish policy combined with New Zealand's relatively fast recovery seem to be serving as rocket boosters that will be testing the 2 year, or even 5 year highs if this keeps going on.

Do you think a day will come where this pair will see parity? I have no idea how the NZ economy would be able to compete on the global stage with their currency becoming that expensive.

**Currency pairs**:- USDCAD

**Time frame**:- H4

**Trade idea**:- I'm looking for a short opportunity in UsdCad.

The market structure is bearish biased. 

After retest, if the market prints any bearish candlestick signal below the Resistance level which is 1.2590.

then go for Short, the target will be the next Support Level which is 1.2350, and set Stoploss above Resistance level around 1.2650 1.2670.

Reddit won't let me add lots of pictures in my reply, or at least I don't think it does. Sorry if I have posted this loads of times in that thread, I am a Reddit amateur!

thought I would share some of my research of the US bond markets, and the dynamics of the yield curves, and it's potential impact on the US Dollar.  The longer term US bond-yields have been steadily increasing since the start of 2021.

[Daily treasury yield curve rates conditionally formatted on each column. Taken from  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. ](https://preview.redd.it/akq9rejg7nj61.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=f33523d8e666fc225dff489566a445d9802748ee)

You can see a steady increase from about five year onwards, whilst the shorter term bond yields are moving down-wards slightly.

When you plot them on a scatter graph, with an exponential trend line, you can observe the yield curve steepening.

&#x200B;

[ The general direction of the yield curve in a given interest-rate environment is typically measured by comparing the yields on two- and 10-year issues. ](https://preview.redd.it/2v7g2mc08nj61.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=95d49af4fda886ba3d493055f77e8c4931a30209)

A yield curve, that is becoming steeper is a sign of expectations for improving growth. With the being a mixed bag across the board with no clear trend, this could be a sign that the dollar is getting more bearish.

This is going to be first post here.

I am new to forex trading and have been reading up to get a grip and an understanding.

I have come across different strategies which are mostly indicator based and i am gonna start back testing them soon.

I was wondering is I can trade based just based on indicators because I have read many reddit post where everyone says price action is the way to go but for me personally I find it easier to understand the indicators.

Should I be focusing more on understanding the concepts of price action and drawing s/r line and predicting based on those with the help of indicators to give me a confirmation?

Also, when drawing the support and resistance lines, i find it confusing as they are not usually clear on the chart. Im not sure if im doing something wrong.

Apology for the long post, but i was wondering if someone can help clear these questions.

My bias on Gold is bearish. However, short-term, we may see a pullback from the monthly support line. The monthly support line was tested 5 times this week and hasn't broken through, but it doesn't mean it will. Momentum hasn't been strong enough yet, but we may see price break through the level after another couple of retests.

What are your thoughts on Gold?

I have a year into Forex and have been trading market structure and price action. I usually analyze the markets in the 1 HR Tf drawing s/l zones and entering via price action (5 min TF) following a retest of the zones. I have been backtesting this method like crazy, but sometimes I feel like I'm not back testing correctly... even though the method is profitable yearly. 

I understand that I can only control my risk and entries but CANNOT control the market... However I never really learned or understood about an exit. What's everyone's experience with exits? Or what exit strategies do you use? Do you just let your trade hit SL or TP after every trade setup/entry? 

Thanks everyone. You are all 🐐🐐🐐","self","https://redd.it/lse9s1"

I live in Canada, and back in April 2020 I wanted to buy some US stocks. To do that, I needed USD. My broker’s webpage said I could obtain this by either using their convert currency button, or by buying USD on the market. Since the former is essentially a market order, I thought i would be smart and place a limit order for USD/CAD. I bought $7700 USDCAD with a limit order. Now fast forward to today, and the USD has crashed quite a bit since then. I had about a $300 unrealized loss at one point because of this.

Well today I realized that loss by selling most of my USDCAD. The thing is, and this is why i’m worried i f’d up, is that it shows I am now long more USDCAD than I actually have USD remaining. I don’t have enough USD to sell to close this position. I have $700 USD and it says I am long $1400 USDCAD, with a remaining unrealized loss of $20. What is going on here? Did i just throw $700 USD in the garbage somehow? Also how can I close this position? Do i buy more USDCAD to make up for the missing $700??

Edit: I realized just now that I have a net loss of $700 USD on my stocks that I bought using my initial USDCAD long position. Is this related to what I'm seeing?

Edit 2: I am with Interactive Brokers, if that helps.

Edit 3: this is the procedure I followed to convert my CAD to USD: http://blog.plsoucy.com/2013/03/converting-usd-cad-interactive-brokers-howto/

Edit 4: ok guys, I fixed it. I bought $1400 USD using the broker’s designated currency converter, and closed the long USDCAD position. There wasn’t a $700 loss waiting to happen after all. I would be interested to know how this could have happened though.","self","https://redd.it/lslrq2"

So... this week, I’ve lost 6.36% of my account.

I’ve identified my recurring mistake, and am hoping that this can be a lesson. Repeating the same mistakes will not get me anywhere in this game, which is why I’m so keen to evaluate trades and reproduce my strengths. I’m hoping I will be reminded of this week whenever I’m tempted to ‘force trades,’ because it’s not the smart thing to do. I'm also sure I'm not the only trader to have these flaws...

It’s not all doom and gloom. This month I’ve progressed my discipline to hold onto winners, now earning 3R from trades that I've previously only earnt 0.9R.

That being said, there are threats to EUR/USD strength that should be considered. First and foremost is the staggering economic projections coming out of the United States. Should reality match estimates, the United States would handily outpace the Euro area in terms of recovery and growth – a theme that would likely give rise to US Dollar strength.

Another concern is risk aversion. US equities are encountering considerable turbulence in recent sessions as US Treasury yields continue to tick higher, prompting investors to reallocate funds as risk-free rates rise. If equity weakness were to gain steam and risk aversion spike, traders may flock to the Greenback in search of safety.

Together, the two fundamental possibilities pose a real threat to the continued uptrend of EUR/USD, but the technical outlook remains encouraging and further stimulus in the United States could see prolonged USD weakness. Thus, Dollar strength is not a foregone conclusion by any means and EUR/USD gains remain on the table.","self","https://redd.it/lt1qac"

&#x200B;

**Fundamental Analysis:**

* for EUR/USD ***specifically***, tend to place close attention to short term and long term rates, nominal and real, and inflation expectations
   * With this, I reference these rates relative to the pair
* Reversal of trend developed in the longer end of curve, 10Y gov't yields, in real terms and expectations
   * Euro real rates negative, US real rates flat/ positive - of my opinion this not reflected in the exchange rate
   * Near term, likely pull back in 10Y yields given run up across both EU and US; however, for US, continued trends I watch related to the value of the 10Y yield indicates additional pressure higher is likely, barring YCC

**Fundamental Analysis = Bearish EUR/USD**

**Positioning Analysis:**

* Heavy user of CFTC COT data for all asset classes, where applicable
* Positioning is at extremes, to the speculative long side, looking at past 10 years
* Extreme positioning can continue, given established trends with AM; however, this is not my base case
* At present, EUR/USD is the only pair experiencing these extremes; similarly occurred in USD/JPY (Yen longs extreme) which have come off drastically in January

I been trading for less then 6 months 
I learned a lot and I have some decent skills 
Recently I blown my account and I am not shocked since I was gambling to flip an account . Long story short I flipped two account but blown them. Due to risk management which I was aware off . Now I have practice on demo with 2% rule while continuing my crazy idea of flipping an account then trade with 2% rules ( I couldn’t get my self to trade 2% even after flipping 300$ to 4K)Now my question what a good amount to start with. I can afford to lose 1-2k. But I want know if I should save for like 6 months and trade with 6k-10k depending how much over time I can handle at work. 
I am thinking with my hard earn money I won’t make the same mistake and will fallow the 2% risk management rule. 
Thanks a lot 🙏","self","https://redd.it/ltp62r"

Schnabel went even further, saying the ECB will fight any big increase in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates as that could choke off the bloc’s economic recovery. The recovery appears to be lagging the US anyway, yet Eurozone sovereign bond yields still tracked US Treasury yields higher and that is positive for both EUR/USD and the major Eurozone cross rates such as EUR/GBP.

So my thoughts are that we will need to return down to chart 1/Chart 3's 0.618 level at 1.38263 before any return to new highs. What do you think? I've often seen the price rise higher again after hitting the 0.5 level before it finishing the pullback to 0.618 and that is where I'm stuck: will the price rise higher again early next week before finishing the pullback to 0.618?? Or may we even just skip 0.618 all together and just head higher off 0.5? Given that 0.618 was hit often on smaller timeframes (Chart 2 + more not shown), I don't think it would be a coincidence to aim for 1.38200 before a new uptrend.

**Weekly Trade Idea for EUR/USD**

Week: 1-5.03.2021

Key event: USD. Non-Farm Payroll

The number of new jobs created during the previous month, in all non-agricultural business. The monthly changes in payrolls can be extremely volatile, due to its high relation with economic policy decisions made by the Central Bank.

We expect a higher reading than the previous month.

## Until Friday, we can expect a light strengthening of the USD against other currencies. It would require a very positive or negative surprising release for the USD to break actual ranging levels.

Key Levels:

* Resistance 1.2300, 1.2400
* Support 1.1950, 1.1900

Trend EUR/USD:

Neutral

Price is ranging between 1.2300 and 1.1950. Last week, the price closed with false up movement and a strong bearish movement, heading support levels. We do not expect a break of key levels before the announcement.

Call to Action/Trade Idea

Neutral markets provide the opportunity to trade both long and short. We will look to buy near supports and to sell near resistance after a price action confirmation.

Check it here:

A lot of people massaged me, and asked for my trading style & tips and so on …I decided to take a 4th challenge, and share it here live and show everything with complete transparency.I contacted FTMO, and according to them no problem in sharing Investor’s credentials, so once I receive it I will post it here.

Please note:

* Don’t buy a challenge to follow this topic, if you can’t trade after passing the challenge there’s no point of taking the challenge in the 1st place.
* This topic is mainly for people who already have a challenge going on, and they struggling with it, as it become more stressful and it might influence your performance.
* Yes I passed it 3 times, doesn’t mean I will do it the 4th time.
* I have win-rate of 55-65%, and there will be RED DAYS for sure, I lose 2-3 days in raw from time to time, don’t be surprised it’s part of the game.
* &#x200B;

My main Rules are:

* I will take 50,000$ account
* My Max daily DD is 2% (1000$) and (0.4-0.6% per setup), and it’s my max daily risk, although FTMO allow up to 2500$.
* Risk per setups are similar, no matter how the trade looks attempting, However, scaling will change from setup to another according to the market.
* All trades will have clear risk, and SL.
* I’m Intra-day trader, I close all trade before the end of the day or once I get to my max DD and call it a day, never hold trades even if they still valid.

There are still people who don't believe that its actually economics who move the markets saying weird stuff like ""the economic news are just there to confuse you"" or ""fundamental trading is somewhat a trading style holding positions for weeks"" even tho I show that its not true.

If you guys really want to turn away from reality (economics) just because it seem to be to much work for you because you rather like to draw fancy trend lines and channels then please don't write these kind of trash (shown above) here, as it might distract people for taking the right actions to approach the markets as it is one of the hardest intellectual battles in capitalism.

**At the end of this post I would like to make an offer to all who can show certain skills and have desire to work with me. I would open a group on Discord and then fully explain my approach to forex trading to these people in a live conversation. We can benefit from each other and grow as a community.**

Now lets go further with the trade I took and published last week.

Some problems occurred during the position. We had a very difficult sitution on the risk sentiment. The SPX has fallen and as we can see in the picture below. The stock index is very inflated and overvalued. It is true that the U.S. has recovered very well from the crisis, but the S&P 500 has skyrocketed too optimistically in recent months. The reason for this was, among other things, the fiscal and monetary measures of the government and central bank, which has fully exhausted their instruments to support the economy. This caused a strong loss of purchasing power and the flight into gold, bitcoins and companies that still had not fully recovered. I had this circumstance in mind and therefore monitored the risk sentiment and the stock index. When I saw how the Tesla share has crashed sharply, my assumption was that the bubble has now burst and took the price crash of the Tesla share as an early indicator.

&#x200B;

[As the SPX fell \(orange line\) it led me to close my position early at the point where the red circle is.](https://preview.redd.it/r33i660oi7k61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c508eb688ef75378d1d4c818fc35c1aeae9e32)

[The Wilshire 5000 Index is widely accepted as the definitive benchmark for the U.S. equity market and is intended to measure the total market capitalization of most publicly traded companies headquartered in the United States. Since the index is worth twice as much as GDP, one could assume that this is a bubble.](https://preview.redd.it/00dpgovhl7k61.png?width=1930&format=png&auto=webp&s=49ee178a2e0de7c41b0fe89c605ac0d47aeaadb4)

[You could argue that the US10Y bond yield has not fallen as an early indicator of growth in the United States. I was overcautious at the time. Now 2 days later what I had prepared myself for has happened. We see that the stock index has fallen back to the level of the last low and that this time the 10y yield also has gone down a bit and the copper price, which can act as a world economic barometer. As a result, the flight to safety increased sharply and the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen gained in value.](https://preview.redd.it/cklgevocn7k61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9173741c7cf13620fcfa834e943f25c7084d584)

Now you know why I closed my position early and why as you can see in the first picture the EURUSD which had the potential to rise further suddenly crashed so hard.

We discussed the pros why SPX could fall further. Now lets talk why it could rise or at least go sideways. And how we can anticipate on that.

&#x200B;

[The New Zealand Dollar is the best currency you could take to go long. We have Good PMI Manuf. The Consumer Confidence is stabilizing. Last GDP reading was high and their main export multinational company in the dairy industry based in New Zealand Fonterra is hotter than GME. The 2y bond yield of New Zealand is relative to the current official cash rate very high as you can see it is scored with 5 points in the excel sheet.](https://preview.redd.it/sliho8e1q7k61.png?width=2614&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d7730d2a0eea14174f58183fadf22a1fb692a3d)

&#x200B;

[The reason for the high probability of an increase in the interest rate is that the RBNZ is very concerned about the house price growth in New Zealand. Don't forget that New Zealand is the place to be for the high society as it is a green and clean country. You wonder why every rich guy wants to build and buy properties there? Well remember, the  New Zealand dollar used to be a relatively expensive currency. With its high interest rates it is also quite expensive to borrow money and build there. In times like today when interest rates are cheap you want to take the chance to borrow and invest a lot in real estate in New Zealand. Think of the time in a few years when the interest rates rise again sharply in New Zealand and the house prices explode, because building houses again becomes difficult \(less supply in the future\). All who had invested then will yield incredible returns. The RBNZ would like to act against it in order not to have the event in the year 2007 and 2008 in their own country.](https://preview.redd.it/oo93q0hqr7k61.png?width=1922&format=png&auto=webp&s=b41d4adf581e9f61c853b76d2c450019b070fb7f)

&#x200B;

[We are close at the 0.5&#37; mark even though the yield has gone down a tick due to Orr's statement. The market participants still believe in a different story at the moment.](https://preview.redd.it/t97tanmf08k61.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecd462137feffed1db8c2e0f933f754321578bf8)

The Australian Dollar und New Zealand Dollar are high beta currencies as they tend to be very volatile. The reason for that is their strong dependency on the primary sector exports (commodities) and therefor their low economic complexity. The same counts for **emerging market currencies.** In my opinion, China is not an emerging market lol

What we want to see for our high rewarding trade is the SPX finding its bottom. What speaks in favor of it? In the chart above you can see the DOW JONES TRANSPORTATION AVERAGE (DTX) in green. According to the Dow Theory, the Dow Jones Transportation Average is considered a leading indicator of the U.S. economy and thus also of the stock markets. Some technical analysts are particularly concerned with the index. Economic development is reflected in the order situation of logistics companies. Required raw materials have to be brought to the production plants long before the final product is transported to the end consumer. That is why the transport index is considered by many analysts to be an early indicator of economic development. It didn't fall beneath the last high (blue horizontal line).

[If the US10Y \(yellow line\) doesn't fall beneath 1.36 and copper \(purple line\) also starts to stabilize, then we could see the stock index building up a bottom. DTX in green.](https://preview.redd.it/fbhzwi9d78k61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=604c52db0844cabe53c4b23f6d71abadee4f298a)

Now lets finish this post as it took to much time from me already hahaha

# NZD/USD

[We want to know where is the fair price and when we can expect buyers to come into play. USD appreciated very strongly as we know from the dollar smile theory. The US has the most richest people who can move the US dollar upwards when thy withdraw their engagements. If the FED holds on their monetary positions to stay dovish even when inflation goes beyond their target then we want to sell US dollars. You can read in my last post \(Fundamental based trade #2\) why we want to sell a currency if inflation rises but central banks doesn't react.](https://preview.redd.it/7nvf3wgt18k61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=884f8d838c169c5f07944c305ce96260c806b471)

# NZD/JPY

[This is compared to the NZDUSD very mild. As Yen is seen as an risk off currency, a shift can weaken it again. And this is what we want to play. Depending on when the risk sentiment shifts, the current price area can be interesting.](https://preview.redd.it/qr2gryxx28k61.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=240bdb2007491ea653ca0abc07db120c333d0308)

**RISK TO THE TRADE:**

\- S&P 500 falls further

\- RBNZ decides to not react to inflation and house price growth

\- Risk sentiment doesn't shift to risk on

&#x200B;

**As mentioned at the start Im looking for people who want to work with me. Lets start on what I have to offer:**

If you want to understand why a currency moves one way or the other and what the backgrounds are. If you are interested in finding a more professional approach to participating in forex trading, then I can help you gain interesting insights. I can show you on what to look at and what factors play a role that can cause a currency to leave its current fair value and find a new fair value. I will share my screen with you and others where you can watch live what I am looking at and how I form an opinion about the currencies. In a group on Discord you can try to find and share with me and others interesting approaches that you have created yourself after learning how to do it.

**Who can participate?** You are a member if you are seriously interested in contributing. If you can do the tasks you have been given independently and share them with everyone in the group. If you have time at least 3 times a week to discuss promising trades and the current economic development in group calls.

For this you need **at least one** of these disciplines:

\- An understanding of economics and the **ability to do extensive research work.**

\- A good knowledge of Excel

\- Good knowledge in Python (web scrapping) or statistics with R

\- Similar skills that can help the group

You can see how much effort goes into each of my trades. All this comes from a one man job. I want to have a group of people who all do a great job evaluating the market. Just like the principle, 10 eyes see more than 2.

**If you think you have what it takes and you also think you can inspire me in the analytical and fundamental then write me a personal message with what discipline you can convince, why you are motivated enough to be active in the group, and maybe even what you have to show.**

**I have send a dozen people my excel sheets. How many people have asked me how my Excel sheet is structured? None of them. If you dont have questions. You are not inspired and not made for the group.**

&#x200B;

So I’ve had a 1:500 leverage account and the margin is around £15. When placing the same trade with my 1:1 leverage, the margin used is still £15. 

How does this make sense? With both trades, I’m using a 1.00 lot size, which is the smallest for US500 CFD. 

Surely with a 1:1 leverage account, it would take more money as I’m not borrowing any from the broker. 

I understand that when trading forex pairs, 1 lot refers to 100,000 of that currency. So a 0.01 lot size would equate to 1,000 if I’m right?

An explanation would be greatly appreciated.","self","https://redd.it/luiw67"

&#x200B;

[Chart 3 - Additional 0.618 pullback](https://preview.redd.it/g4m541vq69k61.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e130311d672529c760108f112f72060cb7e527c)

&#x200B;

So my thoughts are that we will need to return down to chart 1/Chart 3's 0.618 level at 1.38263 before any return to new highs.

Additionally, the previous resistance level at 1.375 could now become support. This trend line sits between the 0.618 and 0.786 levels of Chart 1 as seen below in Chart 5.

This lines up with the 2.618 fib extension profit level almost identically as shown in Chart 6.

[Chart 5 - Chart 1 + previous resistance line](https://preview.redd.it/h1c0wdhp79k61.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9162696e2569b86135bb2e8f68ca783f1d09a1c)

&#x200B;

[Chart 6 - Using the fib extension tool, this 2.618 take profit line also lines up](https://preview.redd.it/es5eu81189k61.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3a1157ddd1ba18f19f48406abf3155c81318201)

Pretty sure this is my aim for the week/next week. Coincides with the UK news and budget + US stimulus, MMs could line all this up for a sharp rise in price and some huge profit from collected buys in the consolidation in the months before and the low low price in March 2020 at 1.14. When you add in all the sellers stop losses getting hit as price rises, this thing could hit high high numbers.

**instrument** :- Gold (XauUsd)

**Time frame**:- Daily

**Trade Idea**:- I'm looking for a short opportunity in Gold ""xauusd"". 

As you can see that bears successfully broke the Support level which turns into its Resistance level.

For the next week just wait for a retest of the broken level.

if the market respects the falling channel, the horizontal resistance level which is 1765, and prints any Bearish Candlestick Signal then go for Short.

Target Will be the next Support level which is 1680.

2. NZD strong, JPY weak.

3. Moving averages not fanned out. ---

4. Bullish engulfer at resistance !.

SL below the 0,3% fib (that is because if I have to take it all the way down it would be too much for my acc risk)

 My question is where do I begin in relation to start getting a feel for charts etc... do I just open a demo account with a broker and use MT4 through them? Or is there better software to do your technical analysis that I should use? I've heard that MT4 is the way to go for most people, but do they work with demo accounts on brokers?

Currency pairs:- EURJPY

**Timeframe**:- H4

**Trade idea**:- I'm looking for a Long position in EurJpy.

As you can see the market just retest the previously broken resistance level now turns into its support level, also the market has printed a bullish long-tail pin bar at HL level.

go for Long, take profit will be 129.40 and 130.00.

incase of support breakout the setup will fail.

Canadian Dollarupdated technical trade levels - Weekly Chart
USD/CAD sell-off fails at critical support – bears vulnerable into March open
Resistance / bearish invalidation at 1.2975 - Critical support steady at 1.2579-1.2619

The Canadian Dollar rally seemingly lost steam against the US Dollar last week with USD/CAD rebounding sharply off key technical support into the close of February trade. The rally covered nearly 70% of the year-to-date range in just two days with the reversal threatening a larger recovery in the weeks ahead. These are the updated targets and invalidation levels that matter on the USD/CAD weekly technical price. Review my latest Strategy Webinar for an in-depth breakdown of this Loonie technical setup and more.

In last month’s Canadian Dollar Weekly Price Outlook we noted that the USD/CAD was trading, “just above key technical support at 1.2579-1.2619,” – a region defined by the 2018 yearly open and the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of 2017 advance. An intra-week drop registered a low at 1.2468 / channel support before rebounding sharply, nearly posting an outside-week reversal to close back above this key support zone. Is a low in place?

Initial weekly resistance stands at the median-line (currently ~1.2770s) backed by the yearly opening-range high at 1.2881. Ultimately a breach / weekly close above the 2020 yearly open at 1.2975 would be needed to suggest a more significant trend reversal is underway- look for a larger price inflection there IF reached. A close below 1.2579 is still needed to mark resumption of the broader downtrend with subsequent support objectives unchanged at the 2018 low-week close at 1.2421 and the 88.6% retracement at 1.2385.

Bottom line: The Canadian Dollar has failed a break below a critical support confluence we’ve been tracking for months now and leaves the bears vulnerable while above. From a trading standpoint, look for downside exhaustion ahead of 1.2579 IF price is indeed heading higher with a breach above the median-line needed to keep the focus on broader downtrend resistance. Stay nimble as we head into the March opening-range. Review my latest Canadian Dollar Price Outlook for a closer look at the near-term USD/CAD technical trade levels.","self","https://redd.it/lvlz7s"

Added analysis and answers to comments/questions in post one.

&#x200B;

**There's no support yet. Why would anyone buy?**

This can be disputed depending upon what timeframe you're looking at. my post references a swing of 3,000 pips to retest the high and then if there is a breakout a rise of 1,000s of pips more. It's based on the weekly chart. The first signs of support have been long established.

 

https://preview.redd.it/3sqnon5p8ik61.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=be5306f73c7a6cca9ba39b497a21823709425bbe

 

Support hit in 2014. Confirmation of the support being strong through 2014 - 2016 and first sign of big buying activity in 2017. Into 2020 we made the double bottom. The rally we've seen since then can be classed as confirmative, if anything ever truly does give confirmation.

To those of you who may not have been trading in 2014, when the EURUSD hit that support level it was *a big deal.* EURUSD had been falling for months. All the rallies it had very quickly put back into new lows and the bear rallies were really strong when heading into new lows. These conditions had been going on in EURUSD for many weekly solidly (And in other USD crosses). When EURUSD hit that level the price swing that followed was about 400 pips right up. I can't remember how long that took, but it was minutes. I think there might have been a FOMC at the time. Long story short, when EURUSD hit that level a very bullish signal was generated intraday.

On timeframes I am using EURUSD is uptrending. It's been the fledgling stages of this uptrend for seven years. The recent bearish trends down on the small timeframes may be nothing more than this.

https://preview.redd.it/mrxuyp5s8ik61.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&s=413f7baf261ff5453135a03c6de63033f98ebf52

 

And why'd I not want to buy into the low of that?

&#x200B;

**Here's some trendlines I drew and this means the one you drew does not matter.**

Here are some trendlines someone posted.

https://preview.redd.it/a16b6gtu8ik61.png?width=1891&format=png&auto=webp&s=d75079d659b59671e94610315b267ced08903e33

 

Let me run through some criteria I use for choosing trendline signals to take and ignore.

&#x200B;

**Angle** \- A correction to a trending move will usually have a trendline with an angle somewhere within the 32 - 48 degrees range. This is due to the way the first part of the correction is fast but then over a while it draws itself out before eventually flatting at the low. Trendlines with more of an angle that this are usually showing the current leg to be trending. The breaks of them more usually retracements that reversals. So remove all the ones with the trendlines that are too steep an angle. These did what they should do, had retracements and then new lows as the short term trend continued.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/due36xwx8ik61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=17b7d488f33ee3f729436ee2fdf23cffcfe5f7b7

 

**Starting point:** I am looking for trendlines starting from the high of the move because I am looking for signs of the big move reversing. I don't randomly start my trendlines anywhere that is not the high. So remove all the ones that start at random places where any sort of high point is. I'm looking for *the* high.

Once you've removed the invalid ones, there is one trendline.

 

https://preview.redd.it/96sk7em09ik61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb5a0cd1b7d239ae5dc5c2f507071236c13ce55

 

There are four touches of the trendline over 15 years. All of them send it into an bear market. Until recently all of them sent EURUSD to a new low. But then there was the double bottom and now that trendline has broken. For 15 years sellers have come in on that line and now they have not. Lower lows have failed and the first higher high ,may be coming soon.

On a breaking of a trendline the pattern we always want to be looking for is a cup and handle pattern.

https://preview.redd.it/dzhzxoo29ik61.png?width=1751&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee9adfc379e68485b46d9c330ee4c7989c4ba305

 

From as far back as 2014 this could have been on the watchlist but only in 2017 did we get the rally that start the formation of this pattern.

The following years brought the handle.

https://preview.redd.it/eohrh9k49ik61.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=af437a0820faff79f10a58d9ea9ef3586e68cea4

 

And now we are getting close to the breakout point that would confirm the cup and handle breakout pattern. That could be the beginning of a strong trend to retest the highs and even drive EURUSD into all time highs. We're probably talking a timeframe of multiple years but if the rally begins and the high breaks I think we can see EURUSD running at over 2.00.

The Euro up trend could be even bigger. If the first rally of the Euro from its inception gives any indicator of how big a second rally would be, we could see EURUSD over 3.00. This would seem like a very strong shift for the dollar but I do think we'd probably be a few years away from seeing Euro being double the dollar. My trade plan for now does not extend beyond trading for a retest of the high.

**Did you get stopped out / why do you use tight stops on a 3,000 pip target**

Yes. I was stopped out my first trades. I hit stops on some of my trades. Others I sold shorts against them to flatten my position when price broke a support level and I then traded out my longs and shorts for a slightly reduced net loss while price was retracing. I am still floating one short trade (0.2 lots) and I have closed my long trades.

Here are my losing trades.

https://preview.redd.it/uk5cdvn69ik61.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=0daf4b7970fd2f7297c6b49cef561c3c1c1420f6

 

I will be buying back in at 1.08 to - 1.088 and if that level breaks my next buy will be 1.06.

I use small stops because I've never went broke sitting out of a market. I can not say the same for letting a loss run. I know if I set a 200 pip stop when we get close it's easy to convince myself to add on 20 pips, it's only another 10%. All these 10%'s add up and when I worked that bit out, I adjusted my risk management style to turn that in my favour, saving myself a little bit of loss on each trade that does not work out.

My stop loss on this trade in the sense of a level I will no longer want to keep trying to buy is 1.028. I've watched that hold for seven years. If it broke that'd make me really bearish on EURUSD.

my intention at this point is to ready myself for if there is a short term higher high made and that then becomes a rally of this magnitude.

If it goes well, that will be a trade I'll never forget. And if I take a few little stop losses and nothing happens, they'll be little losses I won't remember.","https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/2ytMEBnMGRJgmkFFF7BXWT3Fpf3_0QgVuZCohBUbcL8.jpg","https://redd.it/lvolqp"

The Pound has established the most sustained rally that the currency has seen in 5 years. Optimism for a faster recovery has buoyed Sterling rates as the vaccine rollout has seen 20 million Britons already receiving the vaccine to date. The UK has also seen a second monthly rise in payrolls, as 83,000 new jobs were filled in January 2021. Fears of inflationary pressures were squashed by Bank of England Governor Bailey at The Monetary Policy Report Hearings last week. Despite a rise in household savings during lockdown and a potential for a spike in demand as restrictions are soon lifted, the committee believes the price stability mandate of 2% will remain intact. The positive sentiment also spanned to Europe. The German Ifo Business Climate index reached a peak not seen since last October, as the industrial output continues to support Europe’s largest economy despite confinement measures. 

A moderate upward revision to U.S. GDP estimates was made in the second official release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis last week. Growth for the fourth quarter currently stands at 4.1% as a rise in residential investments and government spending contributed to the revision. The manufacturing sector looks to be a source of strength, once again, during a period of weak growth in the U.S. as investment spending in the first quarter of 2021 has surged. Durable Goods Orders spiked 3.4% in January, representing the ninth consecutive monthly rise. In an address to the Senate Banking Committee last week, Chairman Powell reiterated the Fed’s current monetary policy stance, stating that no changes can be expected until there is “substantial further progress” in economic conditions. 

Japan’s industrial production saw a boost from global demand as major trading partners embark on economic recovery. Output climbed for the first time in three months, reaching 4.2% in January. A recovery in growth is likely to be asymmetric, however, as retail sales registered another month of decline during the month.","self","https://redd.it/lvvgtp"

USD

Federal Reserve - The US' monetary policy outlook remains highly influential to USD's fundamental outlook. Policy easing from the FOMC is already at unprecedented levels, and expectations regarding the duration and extent of their emergency measures will continue to influence USD's fundamental outlook. Further and more aggressive easing from the Fed will likely weigh on USD, while expectations for eventual tapering and policy normalisation will likely prove supportive.

Risk Tone - As the world's reserve currency, USD is the most liquid currency in the world, and consequently, the ultimate safe-haven. Although USD does not always exhibit safe haven properties, when markets begin to panic and participants dump almost all other assets to rush into cash, USD becomes the safe haven of choice.

EUR

European Central Bank - Europe's monetary policy outlook remains key to EUR's fundamental outlook. EUR is likely to be supported when the ECB holds a hawkish stance and begin tightening policy, but come under pressure when the central bank holds a dovish stance and is expected to ease policy.

Month-End Flows - During the last few trading days of every month, EUR is usually influenced by month-end flows as banks and institutions rebalance their books and settle transactions. Although not always the case, more often than not, month-end flows tend to be EUR positive, especially against GBP.

EURUSD is the most traded currency pair in the world, making up 24% of daily forex trades according to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). As such, movements in USD often influence EUR, with EUR weakening when USD strengthens and EUR strengthening when USD weakens.

&#x200B;

GBP

Bank of England - Monetary Policy in the UK remains highly influential to GBP's fundamental outlook. Expectations for policy tightening should prove GBP positive, while expectations for policy easing should prove GBP negative.

&#x200B;

AUD

Reserve Bank of Australia - Australia's monetary policy outlook plays a pivotal role in AUD's fundamental outlook. A hawkish stance from the RBA and expectations for policy tightening will likely prove AUD positive; while a dovish stance and expectations for policy easing will likely prove AUD negative.

Risk Tone - Due to its high-beta status, AUD is strongly correlated with the overall risk tone; strengthening in risk-on environments and weakening in risk-off environments.

Commodity Markets - Due to Australia's dependence on its commodity exports for economic growth, AUD is strongly correlated with commodity markets, particularly iron ore, which accounts for 20% of all Australian exports.

China - China is Australia's largest trading partner, accounting for 35% of all Australian exports and 24% of Australia's imports. As such, developments in China and Chinese economic data can prove highly influential to AUD.

&#x200B;

NZD

Reserve Bank of New Zealand - New Zealand's monetary policy outlook plays a key role in NZD's fundamental outlook. A hawkish stance from the RBNZ and expectations for policy tightening will support NZD; while a dovish stance and expectations for policy easing will pressure NZD.

Risk Tone - Due to its high-beta status, NZD is strongly correlated with the overall risk tone; strengthening in risk-on environments and weakening in risk-off environments.

Commodity Markets - NZD is indirectly correlated with commodity markets due to New Zealand's dependence on China and Australia for trade. As both Australia's and China's economies influence and are influenced by the commodities complex, NZD tends to move in accordance with the commodities markets, but also with AUD.

&#x200B;

CAD

Bank of Canada - Canada's monetary policy outlook remains key to CAD's fundamental outlook. Expectations for policy tightening will likely support CAD, while expectations for policy easing will likely pressure CAD.

Oil prices - Oil is Canada's largest export, accounting for over 17% of Canada's exports. As such, CAD is highly correlated with oil prices; strengthening when oil prices rally and weakening when oil prices fall.

Risk Tone - Due to its high-beta status, CAD is strongly correlated with the overall risk tone; strengthening in risk-on environments and weakening in risk-off environments.

Global Economy - Canada is a relatively open economy. As the world's 12th largest export economy and with exports accounting for 34% of GDP, Canada's economic performance and outlook is closely tied to the global economy and the global economic outlook.

&#x200B;

JPY

Risk Tone - With a consistently positive current account and incredibly low interest rates in Japan, JPY has become synonymous with the term safe haven. As the world's leading creditor nation, times of uncertainty result in repatriation flows, supporting JPY.

At the same time, as investors often use JPY as a funding currency due to Japan's low interest rates, investors are often forced to buy JPY to close their risky positions when market's shift to risk-off, further supporting the currency.

&#x200B;

CHF

Swiss National Bank - Swiss monetary policy, or the market's outlook for monetary policy rarely proves market-moving. Instead, the primary influence from Switzerland's central bank comes from their constant interference with exchange rates as they continue to actively weaken CHF when they consider the currency to be highly valued.

Risk Tone - As a safe haven currency, CHF is strongly correlated with the market's risk tone, strengthening in risk-off environments and weakening in risk-on environments

&#x200B;

Okay hope that cleared some things up for you all and trade safe.

Last time we looked at EURAUD price had penetrated the demand zone and broker through the trend line . It was looking like a perfect break and retest and i was literally about to place a sell order. But price just kept on going up so invalidated the trade. As we can see it went up and respected the down trend. So now the same trade setups are still my same idea’s.

See the chart, I only noticed this today as I don't really look at Silver much. It is a hybrid of precious and industrial metal. So it likes economic activity but it also remains very sensitive to the Gold price.

This level is pretty big though, going back to 2010.

Personally I think it will outperform Gold as Gold fades due to less pandemic concern, and Silver reacts to improved market conditions.

See this chart to see the cash-neutral ""spread"" between the two. It's at a level, as are so many things today, waiting to see if risk stays ON or not...","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NZee3qWC2kPtDazoS9amcr2K9bd6TwSrX8Z4fLI9lfo.jpg","https://redd.it/lvyg1x"

(also occasional freelancing)

Last year there was a core algorithm update from from Google that killed the search traffic of one of my ecommerce sites completely.  That did hurt a little bit, but fortunately I still make good enought money from my other sources. 

To avoid the worst case scenarios in the future, I'm trying to diversify my income streams as much as possible. So from the past few weeks, I started learning about day trading forex or stocks. Although I made some profits when paper trading (also small losses). I'm having hard time to understand if that was luck or technical analysis because of few close calls. I'm still learning and probably will get better with time.

&#x200B;

**\[ Main Topic \]**

When learning about trading, I came across a lot of videos/articles about copy trading. 3 days ago after checking a trader's good past trading history of consistent profit and small lose rate, I invested a small amount of 30$ with him. From that day I'm getting a profit of $2-5 everyday. 

That trader is probably scalping the market by taking around 5 trades of 0.01 lot size everyday and closing the positions after getting $0.50 to $2 profit. (https://imgur.com/a/PfjZT8r) Also their win rate is 90% in all their past history. 


So I'm thinking about investing a small amount of 300$ in 10 different traders with good past win rate like that. As there is no benefits of compounding and to avoid the risk of loosing everything, I'll withdraw 100% of the profit everyday or week. If one of them make bad trades or go crazy, he can only wipe the max amount of $30 or less and it's highly unlikely that everyone will make bad trades in a single day ( as the past data suggests )

Math somehow works. But I'm confused that, this can't be this easy.  

As a newbie I'm probably missing something, can anyone give some advice on how bad things go with that process?","self","https://redd.it/lvz2ac"

AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FOLLOWS RISK DOWN

The Australian Dollar has been on a tear over the past two weeks, but the bullish jubilance that has defined markets may be coming to a pause. The spike in developed market sovereign bond yields, but US Treasury yields in particular, has spooked investors, offering a sober reason for a pause in the recent unbridled optimism.

A key factor is that the US Treasury 10-year yield now exceeds the S&P 500 dividend yield. While not as important to asset allocation decisions as the S&P 500 earning yield, it is a key threshold that, now crossed, forces asset managers to reposition their portfolios. To an extent, the thinking goes, why take the additional risk in stocks when I get can a similar total return (capital appreciation plus yields) from bonds?

As asset allocation decisions are made in the wake of the recent bond market moves, it stands to reason that this episode may last than more a few days, thereby preventing a bonafide opportunity for a meaningful pullback in the major AUD-crosses.

Every where you read about triangular arbitrage it describes the theory

That fine for understanding the calculation

&#x200B;

What's not described it how it manifest in practise

My question do you know how and if it's be done in real life in retail forex

&#x200B;

What's your experience or knowledge in these factors

&#x200B;

\* opening a trade and closing in a matter of seconds

(does it work in retail, and doing this on three pairs at once)

I'm on android and there are no labels on anything. So I put $100 on the account. And tried to open a Buy Stop for EURUSD. I placed my SL and TP and my price. However I do not understand what this decimal place at the top is, by default it is set to 1.0 and to the left and right it has +/-0.01 and then beyond that they have +/-0.1 on either side. I assumed at first this was the margin because I kept trying to place orders and getting them deleted for lack of funds. I bumped this number down to 0.01 and was able to execute the order. And immediately lost 5 cents.

On the trade tab I see my Balance as 99.95 and my Equity is 99.95 and my Free Margin is 99.95 (that all makes sense to me) but if I go to my history tab I see my profit of -0.05 (this makes sense too) but why is my Balance on the History tab -0.05 and not 99.95?

Just thought I'd share something that has helped me over the years. Focusing on the outcome of each individual trade can get extremely draining over the months and years. So, one way to focus on the process of your trading rather than the outcome is to look at your trading as a SERIES of trades, where the individual outcome of each individual trade really doesn't matter if you have a profitable trading strategy/process/method. 

&#x200B;

i.e. If I have developed a strategy where I'm 60% win rate over 100 trades, then I KNOW that 40 trades will be losers. So as long as my winners are as big or bigger than my losers, then I KNOW mathematically I will be profitable in the long term, so essentially the outcome of trade #24, or trade # 56, etc. DOESN'T matter!

What's up guys! This is going to be my first post and I just wanted to share this trade that I took today on the 5min chart. Reasoning was: price is in an uptrend, it broke through a key level and retested the level, price was bouncing off the uptrendline with bullish momentum, I saw a bullish pinbar(which is 1 of 2 entry candlesticks I look for), and as an extra confluence price had entered the golden fib zone. To sum it up, a lot of things telling me price was going to continue going up.

Getting that out of the way I wanted to share a tip to increase your win rate(that many people have stated already but is still just as important). The tip being: STICK TO YOUR PLAN. While I am still on the journey to being consistently profitable, throughout my testing on a demo account and now a live account I've realized just how important it is. Every time you see a setup that doesn't fit your plan and you take it, you likely will end up losing. I used to think to myself: ""ah whatever let me take it just incase I win. So be it if I lose, its just a 1% loss anyways but if I win it'll be more than that"". 

The biggest issue there\^ was I was focused on the potential of making a win instead of the potential of making a loss. The other thing was those 1% losses added up, taking only 3 trades that didn't match my plan led me to be 3% down for the week(not even including the trades I took that followed my plan and lost anyways) which led to my consistent losing weeks. When I switched my mindset and thought ""this doesn't follow my plan and can lead to a potential 1% loss"" I stopped taking those trades and went from losing consistently to hitting breakeven and winning weeks. 

If it doesn't meet the requirements you have set and the setup/strategy you have tested, don't take it. It will likely lead to more losses than wins. Once you start only taking trades that meet your plan, you will definitely see an increase in your win rate. Hope this post helps someone, I knew this was a big ""aha"" moment for me when I figured it out.","self","https://redd.it/lwgmln"

Clarity Assistance Needed.","Questions",1.0,1,0,0,4,0,"First time posting here since 6 years of trading. However this has been the first time I've experienced a losing streak of 8 days since the final week of February up to the first Tuesday of March.

At some point, I'm starting to doubt if I have lost touch with my strategy and edge as I got numbed from the bloody streak. As of this writing, I'm already at 11.2% of drawdown, not my greatest since (my greatest drawdown was 38.3% before this, and I came out at 4% nett positive at the end of the month) but isn't doing good to my sanity so to speak. And I have yet to see a blue with a green stroke at the far left.

On top of that, one of the reasons I have flushed out after some diagnostics was that I am susceptible to what we call ""immediate conflicting signals"". Take for example the GBPUSD that I have attached below:

[GBPUSD Daily. EMA 8, 21](https://preview.redd.it/o7ji5m4zlpk61.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cc047863c3a365788ac533c01f73c34ed8fffc5)

[GBPUSD Weekly, EMA 8, 21](https://preview.redd.it/rz7c9dnkmpk61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a648991a99676d374d28fd6d854b7b9509d1dd9)

As we see, on the Weekly timeframe, there was a strong rejection (long upper wick) of 1.4 level of pricing, which coincidentally was also a level held all the way from 5 years back (date annotated), and that from the Weekly, price is pretty far away from the EMA layer.

However, on the Daily, there was this ""conflict"" of Buy **AND** Sell right at the dynamic EMA cloud. And so I drew out the immediate short-term support & resistance zones, and that got me stuck in this loop:

1. If I'm taking the freshest candle from yesterday and go long, am I *BUYING INTO RESISTANCE* of the top layer?
2. If I'm taking the candle from 2 days ago, which is in alignment with last week's rejective candle, am I *SELLING INTO SUPPORT* of the bottom layer?

I'm also an INTJ-T (not sure if MBTI personality plays into trading psychology, citation needed) so getting stuck in this cognitive loop is highly neurotic to me.

Some help would be greatly appreciated!","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/XW2DBuBu0Niz5a4fa-ylEtaGFy0CZJq6Fc9TEYbReAs.jpg","https://redd.it/lwh8ps"

I am a 26y old, I’ve finished college, have a masters degree, great job. In all honesty, I’ve just been bored and really interested in learning how to trade forex. I spend 2-5 hrs a night teaching myself and practicing very small trading. I am going on a few weeks now and seem to understand daily trends. Honestly, I’ve slowly started to noticed that I’m now making a few bucks a day. Not really doing this for any other benefit than wanting to learn and profit (down the line of course).

For those out there who would consider yourself “successful”. More profits over losses. I don’t care the amount. I have a couple of questions for those fully into trading...

1) How much $ did you start with? 

2) How many years have you been going now?

3) What was your main drive? Boredom, curiosity, profitability, networking? 

4) Did you teach yourself (reading a course online)?","self","https://redd.it/lwn9tj"

I actually prefer dollar strength but if the rules are there I'll take it, although I do have a long position open in this pair, so I will hedge against it with a Naked trade.

Has reached a significant resistance zone and rejected it. Not able to work out the risk/reward on my phone but I can tell from tp positions we'll be looking at over 2:1!

I will be taking this trade, I just have a problem with my broker at the moment not letting me place trades.

Hello traders,

I'm expecting a continuation north in the GJ today and will be awaiting a full retest and cotninuation away from the S&D zone at approximately 149.200.

Look for full continuation and execution taking place at approximately 149.400.

I'm looking for my TP at the ascending level. The TP is subject to change and i will ONLY be looking for the ascending level, exactly the same as the last Gold trade.

Risk allocation is 0.75% with a 1.9:1 R:R.

&#x200B;

The cautiously positive tone sees AUD in pole position, with CAD and NZD also broadly supported against the FX majors. In contrast, JPY is the session's laggard, followed by USD and CHF, respectively.

&#x200B;

Commenting on price action and the risk tone, Reuters noted: ""The safe haven U.S. dollar remained broadly weaker on Wednesday as Treasury yields retreated further, restoring some calm to global markets and reigniting demand for riskier assets.""

&#x200B;

Finally, it's also worth noting that GBP remains broadly well supported ahead of the UK's Annual Budget Release. GBPJPY has further advanced beyond 149.00 while GBPCHF tests yesterday's highs, just below 1.2800.

&#x200B;

Looking to the sessions ahead, alongside the UK's Annual Budget Release, today will also see Services PMI reports throughout Europe, the UK and the US.

We closed February last week with the [weekly candle](https://imgur.com/a/c1YdRk3) looking like a really strong bearish signal (a pin bar - see the arrow pointing at pin bar) 


Price is currently rallying because it's still early in the week, so in a situation like this since we're looking for sells - we anticipate a retest

H4 shows a bearish engulfing at the very top right at 85.000. https://imgur.com/a/CowgZwu

That's where we look to sell because this is the move that removed two demand zones.


Inside the supply, there's a Quasimodo. Which also has a DBD right at the very round number we mentioned (85.000). 

That's where we look to place our orders https://imgur.com/a/UAAJIFw

 Currency pairs:- EurNzd

Timeframe:- H4

Trade idea:- I'm considering trading shorts in EurNzd.

Eurnzd is in a strong bearish trend and the market also respects

horizontal resistance level and the trend line.

The market has printed a bearish engulfing candle below resistance level along with multi rejection candles.

I'm excepting a good bearish below resistance area.

Target will be 1.6470, 1.6360.

In case of resistance breakout, the setup will fail.

I'm a former equities analyst and decided to give day trading futures a crack. I have made a fair bit of money investing, however I'm asset rich and cash flow poor since I left my job. I decided day trading would fix this problem. Originally, I started trading FX and futures together. But I was having most of my success with indices, so I decided to head down that road entirely.

I was trading a demo account for seven months.

I blew up probably 20+ demo accounts during this time.

I went down countless down ends as well.

I stated with just trading the open, trading above/below moving averages, buying every pullback, etc. I went down lots of pathways. But, ultimately, I came up with a mean reversion strategy that consists of the 8/21 exponential moving averages and made $10k on demo last week.

I wouldn't have been able to find this strategy without screen time, patience and persistence. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that my pitfall was 90% mental - greed mostly.

I decided to trade real money yesterday (putting $20k in an account) and was up $500 in one hour trading the DAX. I thought it was the right time to test whether my strategy would be successful. If it works in this volatile market, it could work in any market. But, the DAX dropped roughly 500 points from yesterdays open before bouncing and, as you might guess, I averaged all the way down according to the results from my strategy on demo mode.

I could have sold roughly 2 times - once, when I was down $150 and another time when I was down $2000. I didn't sell because I had reason to believe the strategy was working at the time from back testing on demo. I ended up losing $3,500 for the day and was down by $5,500 at one stage. Ultimately my strategy would have made money if I stayed in the trade for 6 hours and really good money if I stayed in it for 8 hours. But, who wants to stay in a trade for 8 hours!

Keep in mind, my strategy is mean reversion and that's why I average down. The market is a rotation mechanism - it goes up and down. I also have had a lot of success on demo with my strategy and last week made $10k, when the market crashed by 15%. I have also blown up a few accounts on demo trying to fine tune my strategy. I had reason to believe it worked. Past results indicated that the DAX  could fall around 300 odd points before bouncing. Not yesterday! lol.

Perhaps it does work. But I didn't stick it out.

I was mentally exhausted by the end and still am.

I have now gone back to the drawing board. I believe my strategy has merit even though I lost yesterday. But I need to go back to demo. I don't have the right to trade real money right now, until I prove to myself that it works. I also need to get some confidence back and attempt to possibly tweak my strategy with what happened.

Don't give up!

If other people can do this, we can as well!

I'm happy to stay on demo for as long as it takes.

I'll provide another update when I start trading live again, if others are interested.Cheers

p.s. I wont specifically state what my strategy is and, regardless, I didn't have success yesterday LOL. I believe anyone who's struggling should go on demo for several months and figure out what works.

pss. This is the ideal environment to test your strategy. If it works in this environment, it should work in less volatile environments; hence, I'm trying to maximise my screen time during the coronavirus panic.

pps. I only stayed in the trade because on past history indicating success on demo. I wanted to truly give myself a good shot at seeing whether it works, despite the cost. I needed to see how my strategy fared up. Ultimately, I went and analysed my mistakes and how I could improve. I came up with a few things.","self","https://redd.it/lwqwv5"

Looking ahead, highlights include US services PMIS, UK Budget, US ADP, ISM services, DoES, OPEC JMMC, ECB's Panetta, de Guindos, Schnabel, Fed's Harker, Bostic, Evans, BoE's Tenreyro

&#x200B;

USD - The Buck is trying to stop the rot and draw lines in the sand right across the board following yesterday's fall from grace, with some assistance from a resumption in UST bear-steepening that has pulled the recovery rug from bonds in general.

However the DXY only just evaded a cleardownside breach of the 90.627 within a 90.871-626 band and the Dollar remains mixed vs major counterparts and weaker for choice against EMs ahead of a busy agenda including weekly MBA mortgage applications, ADP, the final Markit services and composite PMIs, non-manufacturing ISM and more Fed speak before the latest Beige Book.

&#x200B;

GBP/NZD/AUD/CAD - All firmer vs the Greenback, as Sterling hovers around 1.4000 in the run up to the UK Budget and the Pound also picks up momentum relative to the Euro following indecision in the cross around 0.8650 even though final services and composite PMIs were somewhat underwhelming vs manufacturing, flash readings and their Eurozone prints.

Meanwhile, the Kiwi is holding near 0.7300 where 1.4 bn option expiries lie in wake of eyewatering rises in GDT auction prices, the Aussie has taken firmer grip of the 0.7800 handle on the back of firmer than expected Q4 GDP and the Loonie has extended gains to test 1.2600 following decent Canadian Q4 growth and gleaning support from firm crude prices ahead of building permits.

&#x200B;

EUR - Not the biggest net mover or even on a cumulative basis, but in focus amidst the aforementioned mostly firmer than forecast Eurozone PMIs, bar German for a change, and an ECB report via sources suggesting that the GC sees no need to take drastic action to cap debt yields, in contrast to some officials that have advocated enlarging the PEPP. Eur/Usd is back below 1.2100 from circa 1.2113 at one stage when a 38.2% Fib retracement level was hurdled (1.2088) to expose a 50% Fib (1.2117) of the same pull-back from 1.2243 to 1.1992.

&#x200B;

CHF/JPY - The Franc is looking rather deflated after weaker than anticipated Swiss CPI, with Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9150 and Eur/Chf revisiting recent peaks into 1.1100, but the Yen is underperforming and still looking vulnerable to losing its battle to stay afloat of 107.00 given dovish Boj vibes from Kataoka overnight.

&#x200B;

Trade safe

I would like to say I’m not exactly a beginner so think of someone who has been practicing for a little. I just want to know if I have covered everything or if there is more out there? 

I have invested in the past and was introduced to forex many years ago but was too much into just stocks at the moment but now I have an interest. Currently finishing up babypips, not trying to buy courses cause their scams,recently had some people suggest wicksdontlie (raja) and also trading with Monty for the London session. I have been mildly papertrading and scalping is my style but would love to read more things about trading styles and see if another one applies to me. I am currently reading The 10 Essentials of Forex Trading: The Rules for Turning Trading Patterns Into Profit. 

Ready to work on becoming financially free super thankful for any guidance. Would love to work from anywhere in the world as well as go into other investments with the money from forex. 

Please let me know if there is anything else or something new because I can never learn enough.","self","https://redd.it/lx1p7i"

I was going to use this strategy for an evaluation process to join a prop firm. I did back test it and the results was amazing but when it came to forward testing the results was underperforming. This is where I wanted to improve so I read the all of the posts and it's comments again. This is where I found out there were a few parts he contradicts himself. Not hating on him or anything, but to me these major ""mistakes/contradictions"" make me doubt the strategy that is given.

1. In the [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/hee2o0/part_vi_my_10_minutesday_trading_strategy/fvqor5o?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) he says that he prefers a lower win rate with a higher R:R but in a PART VII at the ending he says he prefers a higher win rate instead of a higher R:R.
2. He says he personally uses the -61.8, -100.0, and -161.8 in Part VI only but in PART VII he says he uses 0.0 and -38.2.

So, are those considered major mistakes? Or was he just giving examples on how we can trade his strategy? Also, is anyone trading this strategy with successful results?","self","https://redd.it/lx2rfz"

US DOLLAR TO DEFEND RECENT REVERSAL - GOLD SLUMPS INTO SUPPORT AS BITCOIN PRESSES RESISTANCE
In Monday’s Weekly Strategy Webinar we highlighted the massive reversal exhibited across numerous markets into the close of February trade with the recent US Dollar recovery vulnerable into the March open. Was this just an end-of-month washout? The Dollar index has indeed pulled back with DXY reversing off near-term resistance – the weekly opening-ranges are set with the Majors now attempting to defend the recent turn. The battle-lines are drawn into the close of the week.

The gold price breakdown is approaching initial support targets and while the broader risk remains for a deeper setback, the immediate decline may be vulnerable into these levels. At the same time, the Bitcoin recovery is eyeing the first resistance test and we’re looking for price inflection on both of these setups in the days ahead.","self","https://redd.it/lx2ykm"

Btw I will be starting a Youtube series to educate people on how to make their own market edge. If that is something there is a lot of interest for, be sure to let me know, and I can get started on it ASAP.

Asian equity markets declined across the board as the region followed suit from the losses on Wall St  


US tech stocks underperformed and sentiment was pressured by a resumption of rising yields  
Fed's Evans said he does not expect the FOMC will need to change the duration of bond purchases and views the current increase in rates as healthy  


Fed Beige Book stated that economic activity expanded modestly from January to mid-February for most Federal Reserve Districts  


Looking ahead, highlights include EZ & UK construction PMI, EZ retail sales, unemployment, US IJC, OPEC+ meeting, Fed's Powell, ECB's Centeno, Knot, supply from Spain, France & the UK  


The FX markets, the DXY held on to most of yesterday's gains with price action choppy around the 91.00 level amid the declines in stocks and with the currency unfazed by the weaker than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and ADP Employment numbers.  


The latest Fed comments continued to suggest a lack of concern regarding the rise in yields as Fed's Evans viewed the current rise in rates as healthy in which he attributed the increase to real factors and expectations for a rebound, while Evans also stated he is not thinking about YCC as a policy proposal at the moment and has not set his forecasts for the March SEPs but does expect it will be stronger than December.  


EUR/USD remained subdued around 1.2050 with ECB officials continuing to provide a dovish tilt.  


GBP/USD was uneventful after yesterday's budget announcement given that many of the details had been leaked beforehand.  


USD/JPY retained its recently reclaimed 107.00 status owing to the USD strength and antipodeans were choppy amid the downbeat risk sentiment and mixed Australian data releases where Retail Sales fell short of estimates but Trade Balance printed at a record surplus; antipodeans have picked up ahead of the EU open.  


\- Australian Retail Sales (Jan F) M/M 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%)  
\- Australian Trade Balance (AUD)(Jan) 10.1B vs. Exp. 6.5B (Prev. 6.8B)  
\- Australian Exports (Jan) M/M 6% (Prev. 3%)  
\- Australian Imports (Jan) M/M -2% (Prev. -2%)  


WTI Crude futures were back near yesterday's best levels above the USD 61.00/bbl level as focus remained on OPEC+ in which the JMMC meeting ended with no policy recommendation, although there were mixed views as some member states appeared to be pushing for a higher level of easing of the cuts, while others were more cautious with several members supporting the idea of no curb easing and to roll over the current cuts.  


Elsewhere, gold was indecisive in tandem with the consolidation in the greenback and only marginally benefitted from its haven status, while copper lacked direction amid the broad negative risk tone and weakness in Chinese commodity prices which saw Shanghai stainless steel decline by 6% to hit limit down in early trade.

Last time on Gold we had just created the small supply zone , which proved to be quite a collective area for sells, as price has pushed down strongly since. You could of actually sold from there and made some good profits but that wasn’t on my radar. We currently find price sitting in the monthly demand zone . I’m looking for price to accumulate here and possible buy off the trend line for a push back up to the big down trend line above. The back up scenario is if price was to push through for more continuation to the downside. Wait for the break and retest on that setup. GLIYF

The title says it all. Indexes and risk-on-off traders need to be watching the bond market right now.  


For those who haven't followed this, the US 10 year bond price action is saying that the fed will need to raise rates sooner than it thinks.  


Markets are watching these yields, so if this works as a support level that is bearish for equities and bullish for USD, so we may switch to risk-off.  


It's bearish for equities because with ""safer"" bonds yielding more or less the same as the S&P index, stocks become a less attractive investment. The reason they were so strong was the search for yield. If that is over then so is the rally....  


Wait and see....

Deeper look into FX

AUD/JPY/DXY - Marked divergence between the Aussie and Yen, but not necessarily as a direct reflection of broad risk sentiment that traditionally drives the cross one way or the other.

Instead, Aud/Usd rebounded from just above 0.7750 to circa 0.7815 largely on the back of a record trade surplus swelled by exports rising twice as fast as the previous month, while imports fell at the same pace.

&#x200B;

However, the Greenback is grinding higher across the board, with the index looking to retest recent highs above 91.000 between 90.970-91.223 parameters, and the Aussie also faces relatively formidable option expiry interest in the form of 1.5 bn at 0.7820- 25 assuming it can clear 1 bn expiries at the 0.7800 strike convincingly alongside a pronounced retreat in copper and other base metals.

&#x200B;

Conversely, Usd/Jpy has made a clean break above 107.00 and breached another technical resistance level in the form of the 100 WMA at 107.24, leaving the Yen with only half round number support at 107.50 to rely on.

&#x200B;

CHF - The Franc's fortunes are going from bad to worse, but the SNB will be cheering from the side-lines as Usd/Chf climbs towards 0.9250 and Eur/Chf scales 1.1100 ahead of Swiss reserves data for February on Friday and this month's quarterly policyreview.

&#x200B;

NZD/CAD - Some compensation for the Kiwi as Aud/Nzd holds below 1.0750, but Nzd/Usd is losing more upside momentum having failed to retain grip of the 0.7300 handle, while a dip in oil prices is keeping the Loonie anchored around 1.2650 after its fleeting foray above 1.2600 yesterday.

&#x200B;

GBP/EUR - Both conceding ground amidst the latest Dollar upturn, as Cable meanders mostly in the low 1.3900 area in the UK Budget aftermath and not really reacting to a firmer than forecast construction PMI.

&#x200B;

Similarly, mostly better than expected Eurozone construction surveys have not really lifted the Euro's spirits, while a big retail

sales miss was largely flagged by member state data and partly offset by a steady jobless rate following a downward revision to the previous month.

&#x200B;

Hence, Eur/Usd is still straddling 1.2050 and also capped by decent option expiry interest as 1.3 bn rolls off at the NY cut from 1.2085-1.2100 before attention turns to Fed chair Powell at a WSJ event on the labour market and US economy.

&#x200B;

Trade safe all and if you like this press the tumbs up.

While no one single strategy is perfect, these best practices can be utilized in conjunction with your own trading strategy to identify more favorable entry / exit points in trending market environments.
Trendlines are the simplest and single most important (and largely underutilized) tool in your trading arsenal. Extending a line off key highs & lows in price is an objective way of assessing the gradient or slope of a trending market. This key step can help identify where the price is likely to find support (floor) or resistance (ceiling).

KEY TAKEAWAYS ON TRENDLINE ANALYSIS
Some important aspects to keep in mind when drawing trendlines:
* Two points is speculative, three points confirms- It’s important to note that any two reference points can offer a trendline- however it’s the third touch point that confirms the validity of the slope. Therefore before relying too heavily on a given gradient, look for that third touchpoint for conviction.
* Assessing the break- You should always be trading under the assumption the trendline will hold- but when trying to ascertain whether price is actually breaking, one of the most important things to consider is timeframe. As a rule of thumb, I’ll typically look for a daily close to confirm or invalidate the break of a given trendline. However, when utilizing shorter time-frames price action will be the biggest tell- look for a reaction / change in behavior at the break with a pullback & retest of the slope as support/resistance to validate the break. We will discuss multi-timeframe analysis in more detail in part 3 of this series.
* A break of a trendline should fuel acceleration- When a slope is broken as resistance or support, the subsequent move should see prices follow through in the direction of the break. If prices break and fail to accelerate in that direction, often times this will be a sign of a ‘false break’ scenario (also known as a ‘throw-over’). These exhaustion trades are typical in mature trends and can often precede key reversals in price.
* Don’t chase the break- The way you will want to trade the breach of a trendline is to wait for a pullback in price to test the slope as support – your stop will be below this low. Likewise, on a break of support, wait for the market to retest the trendline as resistance- That pivot high will be your stop on the short.","self","https://redd.it/lxo6zd"

WHAT IS A CANDLESTICK CHART?
A candlestick chart is simply a chart composed of individual candles, which traders use to understand price action. Candlestick price action involves pinpointing where the price opened for a period, where the price closed for a period, as well as the price highs and lows for a specific period.
Price action can give traders of all financial markets clues to trend and reversals. For example, groups of candlesticks can form patterns which occur throughout forex charts that could indicate reversals or continuation of trends. Candlesticks can also form individual formations which could indicate buy or sell entries in the market.
The period that each candle depicts depends on the time-frame chosen by the trader. A popular time-frame is the daily time-frame, so the candle will depict the open, close, and high and low for the day. The different components of a candle can help you forecast where the price might go, for instance if a candle closes far below its open it may indicate further price declines.

INTERPRETING A CANDLE ON A CANDLESTICK CHART
The image below represents the design of a typical candlestick. There are three specific points (open, close, wicks) used in the creation of a price candle. The first points to consider are the candles’ open and close prices. These points identify where the price of an asset begins and concludes for a selected period and will construct the body of a candle. Each candle depicts the price movement for a certain period that you choose when you look at the chart. If you are looking at a daily chart each individual candle will display the open, close, upper and lower wick of that day.

Open price:
The open price depicts the first price traded during the formation of the new candle. If the price starts to trend upwards the candle will turn green/blue (colors vary depending on chart settings). If the price declines the candle will turn red.
High Price:
The top of the upper wick/shadow indicates the highest price traded during the period. If there is no upper wick/shadow it means that the open price or the close price was the highest price traded.
Low Price:
The lowest price traded is the either the price at the bottom of the lower wick/shadow and if there is no lower wick/shadow then the lowest price traded is the same as the close price or open price in a bullish candle.
Close Price:
The close price is the last price traded during the period of the candle formation. If the close price is below the open price the candle will turn red as a default in most charting packages. If the close price is above the open price the candle will be green/blue (also depends on the chart settings).
The Wick:
The next important element of a candlestick is the wick, which is also referred to as a ‘shadow’. These points are vital as they show the extremes in price for a specific charting period. The wicks are quickly identifiable as they are visually thinner than the body of the candlestick. This is where the strength of candlesticks becomes apparent. Candlesticks can help traders keep our eye on market momentum and away from the static of price extremes.
Direction:
The direction of the price is indicated by the color of the candlestick. If the price of the candle is closing above the opening price of the candle, then the price is moving upwards and the candle would be green (the color of the candle depends on the chart settings). If the candle is red, then the price closed below the open.
Range:
The difference between the highest and lowest price of a candle is its range. You can calculate this by taking the price at the top of the upper wick and subtracting it from the price at the bottom of the lower wick. (Range = highest point – lowest point).
Having this knowledge of a candle, and what the points indicate, means traders using a candlestick chart have a clear advantage when it comes to distinguishing trendlines, price patterns and Elliot waves.","self","https://redd.it/lxott6"

The other thing is, when i open a position and i set a SL and TP, the position goes all the way to my SL and then back to my TP and the position is closed. what the hell? this happened multiple times. what am i doing wrong there? am i setting my SL too hard, should i be more flexible with it? if i set my SL higher and things do go south, i would be losing more than i want to.

Oil surging up over 5% as OPEC+ decided not to hike outpout by 500k B/D in April

Really caught the market by surprise this. Far more hawkish than expected. But Russia still seems keen to open up the taps

Fed Chair Powell pushed back on the idea of an imminent implementation of a “Twist” as he says current stance is appropriate and if conditions change materially, Committee prepared to adjust its tools as appropriate.

The rise in rates caught his attention. He would be concerned by disorderly conditions (clearly last week’s didn’t meet that definition) or a persistent tightening in conditions that threatens the Fed’s goals.

Initial jobless claim also in green, better than expected

Right now the markets are looking for a print of 182K, but given the incoming data there is a possible downside risk to forecasts as two of the biggest weighted factors in NFP forecasts (ADP and ISM Services Employment sub-component) saw sizable moves lower this week.

&#x200B;

However, there are some analysts who point to the fact that some businesses were allowed to open which could place upside risk to the release. What does that mean for us, it means we want to be very careful with today's print, especially after yesterday's speech from Powell, with a lot of focus turning to the labour market.

&#x200B;

The reaction to this event could see exacerbation of current market moves. A much better than expected print would expect to see further US10Y and Dollar upside, while a major miss should see the opposite, but given last night any miss in the data would probably be more short-lived in terms of its impact while a very big beat could see a lot more momentum and sustainable price

reaction.

&#x200B;

Given the current climate and focus on the bond market I would anticipate the follow price reactions from today's NFP:

&#x200B;

Deviation above the market's maximum expectation: US10Y-UP, USD-UP, Gold-Down and Equities-Down

&#x200B;

Deviation below the market's minimum expectation: US10Y-Down, USD-Down, Gold-UP, Equities-UP

&#x200B;

Do keep in mind that equities are a bit of a wild car for this one, given the stress about rising yields and its implications for stock (unwarranted in my opinion) equities might be a tricky one to gauge, best to wait for the event to pass and see how the market reacts.

Trade Safe

\-In my plan

\-Losses are part of the game, so I'm really not sure how I can criticise myself here.

&#x200B;

**Key takeaways**

I’m very happy with this week because I stuck to my plan, and ended the week up, even with few setups this week.

\+3R isn’t my best week, however I’ve not given profits back to the market with stupid trades, in unfavourable conditions, something I did last week -\_-.

Going forward, I will collect statistics regarding trailing stops. With my ‘best trade,’ there was potential to trail at 1.5ATR for 8.5R instead of 3R, as shown here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/47SfjWdn/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/47SfjWdn/)

I'm confident a fixed 3R is profitable, so I'm still trading this until I have reliable statistics to support a change in strategy.

He was a young boy working in a seaport in the city of Meowtown. The port was the busiest place in the city as it was the center of the fishery for the whole country. Every morning dozens of boats went to the sea and return full of fish if they are lucky.

Rick was doing a dirty job, packing the boats, move fish to the freezer, and from the freezer to buyers' carriages. His favorite part of the day was the market hours. When the cats with the thickest wallets gathered on the main square near the port to buy and sell fish. It was the place where most of the fish were sold and bought. The auction was run by his uncle named Fat Tony. For Rick, Fat Tony was like a teacher. He always answered his questions and tried to explain how complex things work. Rick learned from Fat Tony a lot. How fishery works, how fish is stored in the freezer, who are the biggest buyers, and where do they take fish after the auction. With all these insides and connections to the sea, Rick started to see some patterns in the fish supply and demand. After spending months on the market Rick started to see that some days he is right about his prediction of where the price will go in a few days.

With this in mind, he came to Fat Tony with a question, ""How can I earn money if I know that the price will go up the next week"". 

\- You can't, laugh Fat Tony. You need money to do this. If you had some you would buy some fish today and sell it later. Of course, you need to pay some commission for the freezer to store it. But if you sure the price will go up, it is nothing.

\- May you land me some money, asked Rick. I'm 100% sure, he continued. And the price won't drop more than 50 cents during the week, I'm sure about that.

\- Well, if you are so sure, started Fat Tony. How much money do you have?

\- 10 dollars, these are all my savings

\- Ok little guy, we can do something here. I'll lend you some money to buy fish now. But you will cover the loss from your pocket money if it goes the wrong direction. Are you ok with that?

\- Sounds fair, immediately replied Rick

\- I will keep your 10$ as collateral. And I will have your fish in my freezer and will sell it immediately if the price goes 50 cents down. I will borrow this money for free, only this time. Next time I will charge some percent for using my money, this is how money works kid.

\- No problem, how much can you borrow?

\- Well if the maximum risk is 50 cents per contract, you can buy 20 contracts with your 10 dollars collateral, without putting me at risk. With the price of 20 dollars per contract, it is 400 dollars. And it makes 1 to 40 leverage.

\- You will lend me 400 dollars?

\- Yes, but your 10$ will be kept as a margin until we finish with this trade. You will not get any money in your hands. I will work as your broker, executing your trades. You tell me when to enter the trade and when to exit. But when the critical drawdown will happen, I will exit the trade myself. Understood?

\- Yes uncle Tony, thank you very much. You will see, I won't let you down

\- I got your money kid, you can't let me down. You should worry only about yourself

 Hiring in the U.S. economy accelerated sharply in February, reviving hopes of a rapid recovery from the winter wave of layoffs due to Covid-19 restrictions.

Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 379,000 through the middle of the month, almost double the 182,000 consensus forecast. The number for January was also revised sharply by higher by over 100,000 to 166,000.

I am improving my trading skills, and trying to explore strategies and techniques to help other blind or visually impaired people start trading, so we all don't need to reinvent the wheel again and again.
Basically, I base my strategies on action price and some simple volume indicators.
Usually, charts are less accessible to me than numeric values, tough there are some apps, such as Yahoo Finances, that can be used to somewhat read chart prices.
I'd like to find a tool, an app, a webpage, whatever, that allows me to get data for a given period of time, for example: open, high, low and close, from today at 5:50, in 10 minutes steps, or 5 minutes, or whatever, this way I could have a much better idea of how a pair is evolving over time.
For example, in mt4 I can consult OHLC values for a given period ending right now, from 5 minutes to now, from an hour to right now, but cannot -or I don't know how to- go backwards by time intervals.
Another interesting point would be being able to get the same info from the first hour of an opening market, as it is used in some strategies to establish resistances and supports for the given day.
Any idea, suggestion, comment is welcome. Not only for this particular aspect, but in case you know about any other tool that can be useful for the blind, the more numerical and less graphical, the best.
Thanks and excuse my English.","self","https://redd.it/lynxhm"

I've been studying trading for a few months now and have been practicing with a demo account with some success (and some failures).

Just wondering how many different markets you all trade in or would recommend for a beginner.

I find myself jumping in probably too many , and its hard to keep track of them all. Was thinking might be better just to focus on 1 or 2 currency pairs, or commodities, though temptation often gets the better of me and I end up over trading and forcing trades .

Also, im fully aware of the risks associated with CFDs, and it's similarities to gambling, so please no memes advising me to go to the casino instead :P

We are currently 88 pips up on this trade, price is currently in a very important position for me to determine the direction for the near future.  
We are in a downtrend and broker the long standing demand area. Price created a big daily demand zone where we currently sit. We could find support here and price could decide to break trend a find some bullish movement. If it looks to start breaking through the trend line then exit the trade with what you can. If we get the break through below then i think for sure we will see price visit the weekly demand zone below for TP projection. GLIYF

I did an analysis on the pair CADJPY in H1 and I have at least 3 indications (Stoch, MacD Divergence, Price Action ..) which indicate a possible overthrow down on this pair of currency.

Notice (along with transaction volume) how **smart money** drives the price down with a lot of selling.

I have started studying Forex since 6 February of this year. I am determined to learn Forex trading because my day job is just that awful. In my country, $500.00 is already a very livable monthly earning and I earn almost more than twice that from my day job. I currently have $3,000 cash, a third deposited in my forex trading account and my equity is effectively double that because of the broker's bonus. My goal is to be able to make even just $500.00 a month until I'm able to grow my equity slowly and learn to trade better. I plan to achieve that by July this year and become a full-time day trader. By then I will have a years' worth of living expenses (from my salary alone).

I enrolled in a reasonably priced course that teaches mainly market structure and price action strategy. Using their strategy, my current win rate at live trading is 50% and I have identified my errors in trading such as trading against the trend and setting a too tight stop-loss. I am very strict in my risk management that I even risk less than 1% of my equity. I have been fortunate enough to find a signal that earns a bit consistently and ""buffers"" my bad trades. From his trading history, I expect my equity to grow 40% monthly, which the signal has done so far for 2 months now.

I used to just spend my free time playing video games but now I really got into studying forex; reviewing the course materials I availed of, reading a few trading books, watching YouTube videos, and staring at charts analyzing.

Now my question is: how am I doing as a trading novice/learner? Do you think that my plan is feasible? Do you have recommendations on how I can continue on the path to becoming at least a meagerly profitable trader?

I really appreciate all your responses and I want to thank you very, very much. I wish you all the best!","self","https://redd.it/lzcw3w"

Intro:

I will start by introducing you their importance, in average 70% of the volume traded in the market comes from the institutional side, and about 30% is coming from retail investors. That basically means that the ones who control the market are institutions, they have a lot money under management, therefore they are able to move the markets, so, if they are in control they are the ones who buy the absolute bottoms and sell the absolute tops, but how they make the decisions of buying or selling and where? Seems like nobody is asking this types of questions. They fullfil their orders by taking advantage of the obvious behaviour of the retail participants, in other words they stop out, trigger stop orders and accumulate positions in zones where the retail investor is looking to do the opposite.

If I have explained it well enough and you have understood it correctly, you will now know:

1. Why almost never obvious support/resistance levels are respected to the pip (isn't everyone buying support selling resistance? Why does it extend above/below? You tell me)


2. Why patterns like head and shoulders work? It won't be that the first shoulder is the first phase institutional accumulation forming a maximum for the following breakout through that level to trap retail traders into buying to form the head (false breakout), and the shoulder is a re-accumulation phase to continue selling while retail traders still keep buying because, of course, is an ""uptrend"" you ""shouldn't"" sell.


3. Or for example how other patterns forms? Like double, triple tops/bottoms, cup and handles, pennants, flags, harmonic patterns (like bat or gartley patterns), do you have any idea? It won't be again related to the institutional manipulation?


4. What about trendlines are they respected to the pip? Or they trap the retails in trendline breakouts to continue in the opposite direction?


5. What about range breakouts? The same? It won't be an accumulation phase to conclude turning in the direction where they have accumulated positions, to take price to a level where they will start again the manipulation proccess?


6. What about fibonacci, isn't common to buy/sell between the 38,2% - 50% retracement and place your stop below/above the 61,8% level? What normally happens in the 61,8% ""support/resistance levels"", are they respected to the pip? Or they stop you out to the pip to continue in the direction you where anticipating for?

This is just some examples of the evidence about manipulation, and it is the basis of how I trade and understand markets, and now I will like to understand why nobody is talking about it and what do you think as (more than probably) retail investors?

Also, if for any reason you doubt me, I encourage you to verify for yourself if what I am saying make sense in the charts. Look for price turns in any market (which is where institutional investors have buy/sell), now tell me, do you see any kind of stop out through any previous maximum/minimum and after that a price turn? Or do you recognise any manipulation pattern in the area where price have turned?

Also, what would happend if, for example, once the price has break through an obvious resistance level where there are many stop losses (liquidity), you decide to instead of buying the breakout, sell it, will you sometimes short the exact top?","self","https://redd.it/lzl44k"

**Weekly analysis for USD/CAD**

Week: 08-12.03.2021

**Key event: CAD. Interest Rate**

Interest rate at which major financial institutions borrow and lend overnight funds between themselves;

We expect a similar reading to the previous month.

## We see a slowing momentum on the actual trend. A negative surprising data value could reverse the actual trend direction.

## Key Levels:

* Resistance 1.3000
* Support 1.2500

**Trend USD/CAD:**

Bearish/Neutral

Price is reacting to old demand levels. Price closed last week with a bearish pin bar. We see both bullish and bearish signals.

**Call to Action/Trade Idea**

We will look to sell near resistance after a confirmation signal. We will look to buy near supports after a confirmation pattern. Only a surprise on data release could lead to a break of the key support.

I want to discuss a new trade with you but this time I will make it a little bit shorter.

First of all, lets talk about the trade I published las week.

My NZDUSD trade didn't work out and I closed my trade very early in a small loss as a friend of mine made me aware of Powells announcement.

Lets go over to another trade I will take on the next week.

The circumstances have not changed for NZD. My reasons for my bullish attitude you can read in my last post. For AUD, some things have changed. The good thing about an AUDNZD trade now is that we do not have to take into account the risk sentiment, as both currencies have a high beta. Very important to take into consideration as we are in uncertain times.

* The US Dollar set a fresh three-month-high on the back of a strong headline in the Non-farm Payrolls report.
* US Treasury rates have been surging so far in 2021 and this has helped to create a sharp move in the USD/JPY pair.

The general consensus coming into this year was for a continued combination of equity strength helped along by a weak US Dollar. And to be sure, the basis which seemed to drive that prognostication remains the same – the Fed remains loose and dovish with little indication of any impending rate hikes, echoed again by Chair Powell last week. But we’re in one of those strange periods where markets appear to be going in the opposite direction as US rates continue to lift even as most inflation indicators remain tame and subdued. This isn’t to say that there isn’t inflation, as one look at commodities like Copper, Lumber or Tin highlight some pretty sizable price gains; and this is likely playing at least somewhat of a factor in that continued divergence between rates markets and what the Fed says that they want to do. But as rates continue to lift in anticipation of a greater recovery, the US Dollar has continued to trade higher, setting a fresh three-month-high earlier this morning on the back of a really strong Non-farm Payrolls report.
The US Dollar is testing a confluent spot of resistance ahead of the weekend, marked by a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at 91.93 and the underside of a prior bullish trendline that projects into the same vicinity. The Dollar did test above this level in the aftermath of NFP, albeit temporarily, before prices quickly pushed back to this key area on the chart.","self","https://redd.it/lzqc18"

[EURCHF has been in a strong uptrend for some time now. However we can see that last week this level of supply was respected.](https://preview.redd.it/upyulzohbml61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=69af067499c6f94c885b56c6c657de3932b7fb96)

[This movement can be seen clearly on the 1H timeframe. A quasimodo  has formed as the recent downwards movement broke the lower high marked in blue. The question for me is this enough to brake the trend? The demand below that had a nice reaction so it is still possible that the higher high will be broken. If strong rejection occurs around the supply at the top, I believe this could be a great area to look for shorts](https://preview.redd.it/n298zp10cml61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=fca59c0c92ed5034e97cd38f35fc4dc275c79014)

[Price reacted really well to this level of supply last week. Price also consumed the demand that I marked here. Over all I see the downwards momentum over taking the bullish. So, I think if price revisits the recent supply without closing above it, this could be a great place for shorts. ](https://preview.redd.it/2zvhjmsc2nl61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd48b1afb033c2f5ccfffc68f04881868724a9bd)

Headline news in the UK last week was Chancellor Sunak’s budget release. Given the impact COVID-19 has had on the economy, the announcement made by Sunak indicated fewer austerity measures than expected. Corporation tax will rise to 25% for large business in 2023 and a freeze on income tax thresholds will see more than 1 million new tax contributions as a result. The furlough scheme (where the government pays 80% of wages) will continue until September. The Budget should raise 29 billion pounds for the UK by 2025. Despite the support, the economy is set to be 3% smaller than it would have been without the pandemic according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Manufacturing sector continues to grow steadily as new orders climbed taking output to 55.1% for February. Growth was constrained by overstretched supply chains and rising costs. 

Triumph for the U.S labour market came in the form of better-than-expected payroll numbers for February. A total of 379,000 new jobs were added to the economy for the month against a forecast of 197,000. Additionally, the unemployment rate moved lower to 6.2%. Manufacturing and Services sectors showed signs of strengthening, if perhaps, at a slower pace than expected at this stage. Growth cooled slightly for the Manufacturing sector in February at 58.6% however, this represented the second fastest spike in growth since April 2010. The Services sector saw its ninth consecutive month of growth at 55.3% yet the data indicates a significant fall in pace of output due to supply bottlenecks. 

China’s Manufacturing sector grew at a slower pace in February, only just climbing into expansionary territory with output at 50.6% against a forecast of 51.1%. Government stimulus and rising exports had led the way in recovering the sector ravaged by disruptions related to the pandemic outbreak, which is still experiencing residual weakness.","self","https://redd.it/m050dt"

I trade all 28 pairs and normally have around 10 forex trades running daily. Before entering any trade, I know which pair to trade, where my stoploss will be and what my risk will be. However I am trying to optimize my entries hence looking for some suggestions.

Edit- I probably should have posted an image with the EUR/USD chart. Sorry.

Currency Pairs:- GbpNzd

Timeframe:- Daily

Trade idea:- I'm looking for a Long opportunity in gbpnzd. 📈

📌 1st scenario if the market breaks the resistance level which is 1.9350 and holds this level and prints any bullish price action signal then go for long in gbpnzd.

📌 2nd scenario if the market retests again 1.9100 support level and prints any bullish price action signal then go for long in gbpnzd. Target will be the next resistance level which is 1.9750.

* Rising yields may weigh on the technology sector, buoying cyclically sensitive names

Reflation, Stimulus, Yields, Gold, Asia-Pacific at Open:
Wall Street equities had another mixed session as reflation hopes inspired investors to rotate out from growth and into value names. The Dow Jones index finished up 0.97%, while the Nasdaq 100 index tumbled 2.92%. The technology sector continued to underperform cyclically-sensitive ones such as energy, financials and consumer discretionary. Rising yields further weighed on the tech sector, which tends to offer lower dividend yields and thus are more susceptible to profit-taking activity.
Prospects for reopening also encouraged market participants to liquidate the white-hot tech stocks, which have largely outperformed during the pandemic.

Hey guys, I've been a long time lurker and have been trading on the low. I felt like sharing my thoughts on the **USD/CHF pair**, as I hope it might be useful for others. I wrote a full post on tradingview of which I'll post the link just below, but I'll summarise everything in this thread.

# Summary:

\- Long term uptrend, today has been bearish

\- Low volume today might signify weak bearish action

\- Price seemed to slow down at trendline and MA100

\- My indicators are giving a buy signal

Iv been on the hunt for an iPhone app, and maybe you guys can help me.

So, with my strategy, I like to move me SL whenever price reaches a certain level. Now sometimes I place a trade during the day, but when I am asleep I need to move my SL (because price would have reached a certain level).

I use the tradingview app to set my price alerts, and they work during the day. But the alerts never wake me up when I am sleeping (and I lose out on some profits because of it).

Do any of you guys have a solution for a problem like this? I was trying to find an app that works like an alarm clock (Eg: when AUDUSD reaches 0.76900, my phone will set off an alarm clock that wont stop unless I tap on a stop button). I even thought of something with IFTTT to trigger a phone call to wake me up.

Anyways, if anyone has a good solution for a fix to this it would be great :)

And It hurts me so much that I have a pretty good forex knowledge, but I still can’t make but fake money. If I had but small real account I could manage it and begin mylife dream. I am not writing this begging. I am writing because I’ve tried everything within my reach and possibilities ,but I was unsuccessful. If anyone could help me with something he would make not my day, but maybe my life…","self","https://redd.it/m1t4kb"

Good technical setup.

Wait for full breakout above moving averages, upper channel limit and S&D zone.

Wait for price to retest any of the three levels so long as the 200EMA is NOT broken and closed beneath.

Sniper crits on side.

Pull the trigger.

Risk allocation is 0.5% with 1.7:1 R:R

&#x200B;

First of all. This pair will be directly affected by this afternoons BoC interest rate decision which COULD be a big deal but here's my thoughts.

Technically, the pair has completed a full BCR of the 15m moving averages.

There is a golden cross underway.

Entry criteria will be sniper crits on side as well as a break through of the 1.50600 level which is the previous highs.

We COULD see a 4h 8EMA gap formed in two hours should price fail to break the 1.50600 level which would put me OFF this trade idea.

Now, BoC are deciding on rates today. I strongly believe the rates will remain unchanged for the cad. My reasons for this are:

The economic reconditioning process in place to counteract the effects from the pandemic has been highly effective with their growth overtaking their prior forecasts. From my findings, the BoC's original trajectory for growth recovery was levels around 4% increase in GDP when in fact, their GDP actually smashed through at a staggering 9.6% increase which is great.

As we touch on other factors, we have seen Oil prices surge and we also have the US currently showings signs of strong economic recovery (at least for now) too which will likely keep CAD relatively afloat.

However, ALL this provides is reasoning behind CAD rates remaining the same. The fact is, rates remaining stable isn't great in itself at 0.25% and the Canadian economy has a really long way to go before it reaches the end of its reconditioning process and therefore, I expect the unchanged rates this afternoon to stagger the CAD and bolster the EC trade idea overall.

&#x200B;

**Now, Risk.**

&#x200B;

CAD rates are released this afternoon at 3pm gmt. I expect we could see an entry prior to the release of this news. SHOULD the trade trigger 30 minutes before the release, you are NOT to take it. Should the trade trigger 15 minutes AFTER the release, you are NOT to take it.

&#x200B;

On that basis, anytime before 2:30pm gmt is fine to take the position so long as you have a conservative approach.

&#x200B;

Risk allocation for this idea will be 0.5%.

&#x200B;

If the position is triggered at 3:30pm my risk allocation will double to 1.0% (although I feel this will be highly unlikely).

&#x200B;

So, i think i've given you a good enough breakdown.

&#x200B;

Commodity:- Gold (XauUsd) Technical Analysis | Gold Trade Idea

Timeframe:- H4

Trade Idea:- I'm looking for a short opportunity in gold (xauusd) until the market didn't break the resistance level which is 1766.

📌 Trend Bais, if the market breaks 1705 support level and prints any bearish price action candlestick signal below broken support level then go for short and the target will be 1680 support level.

📌 Counter Trend, if the market break resistance level 1720 and prints any bullish price action candlestick signal above this level then go for long with tight stop loss and the target will be 1766.

**The issue**: Last two trades have been running in profit, at 2.5R and 2.9R (Less than a pip away on 15 pip target). Surely it's stupid to be losing 2R when I've been up 5R, and theres a better way?  


**My proposed change** is option of manually closing above 2R to 'preserve capital.' I don't *need* 3R because 2R is already profitable, so I'm thinking even if I manage it badly, it shouldn't significantly affect me.  


I'm aware that these are two trades, but I know this has occured before to me. I'm also wary because I caused issues, closing trades way too early a few weeks ago, thats why I've put the 2R requirement in.

I made some good money with it, and the system works great in a ranging market, but in a trending one, you often get taken out by the strong trend, if you do not combine it with price action. I need a non repaint indicator filter that signals the end of a trade, and the start of a new one.

Rules:  1.(Only use for H1 VS M15) (both direction must be align)2.Sell/Put when Down arrow in RED ZONE (Preferable) either in H1 TF or M15 TF3.Buy/Long when Up arrow in BLUE ZONE (Preferable) either in H1 TF or M15 TFTP : Next Line FIB

I tested this out with a demo account and i was suprised that the strategy actually works really good.

Swap charges can add up over time, affecting the profitability of your positions, so it’s important you understand how they work and factor them into your decision-making when planning your attack on the market.

*Forex swaps* can be a little confusing to the uninitiated as the term swap is used in various fields of finance.  Other names for forex swap include rollover and carry – these are less ambiguous as they only refer to the overnight interest charges we’ll be talking about here.

The term swap comes from the fact that through buying and selling currency on margin, you are swapping one interest obligation/right for another offsetting one.  Rollover comes from the fact you are rolling your position over from one day to another, as does carry.

Every currency pair you trade will have its own interest charge or credit rate applied to long or short positions, unlike exchange rates, these rates don’t fluctuate very often in normal market conditions.

They will generally slowly move in one direction over time with changes in monetary policy.

## Forex Swap Explained

### Why is swap paid and levied in the forex market?

When trading in the forex market, you are always using some leverage.

You never physically change the ZAR or USD in your account for any other currency.  The currency in your account is your collateral, used to borrow and take positions in other currencies.

If you open up a short position in USDZAR, you are borrowing US Dollars and selling those dollars to buy the Rand.  If the Rand strengthens against the US Dollar and you close your position, you sell the Rand, use the proceeds to pay back the US Dollars borrowed and keep any difference as your profit.

While you were borrowing US Dollars, you were levied interest charges on that loan, but while you were holding Rand, you were receiving interest on your holdings.  The difference between these two interest liabilities/rights is swap.

As South Africa consistently has a much higher interest rate than the US, you will likely always be paid swap on this trade and always be liable for it if you take the other side, betting against the Rand.  This is important to consider when making trading decisions based on a longer-term thesis – you may be right that the US Dollar is going to appreciate over the next 6 months, but is paying interest on a long USDZAR position for an extended period of time the best way to capitalise on your thesis?

You may want to look elsewhere in this case for a currency with interest rates closer to the US, reducing your swap liabilities whilst still betting on prolonged USD strength.

&#x200B;

Conversely, if you are seeing prolonged USD weakness over the coming months, a short USDZAR position could be the perfect play as you will profit if your thesis is correct and receive daily interest payments for the duration of your trade either way.

### Who sets swap rates in the forex market?

Swap rates in the forex market are determined by your broker, based on the rates they pay and receive in the interbank market.  In turn, these rates are based on the official cash rates set by the world’s central banks.

Brokers have to charge a small markup spread to manage their own risk and generate a profit from their brokerage activities.  As such, if you are trading a currency pair where the official interest rate difference is only small, you are unlikely to be paid swap on either side of the trade, but you will only pay a tiny amount on whichever side you take too.

If you don’t want to worry about swap charges, pairs like this with small rate differentials can be a great option.

### Forex swaps in practice

Forex swaps will be levied or credited to your account every day at 4:59 PM NY, the end of the trading day, regardless of what time zone you live in or how long you have had your trade open.

This means if you hold a trade past that time, you will pay or be credited a full 24 hours of interest, regardless of whether or not you held the trade for 10 minutes or 12 hours.  For short-term, highly leveraged trades, this is definitely something you want to keep in mind – note you pay/receive interest on your position size, not the balance of your account.

Another thing to consider is the 3 x swap day, this is generally Wednesdays but can vary between brokers.  At the end of every Wednesday, traders who are rolling over their positions will pay or receive a full three days of interest charges on behalf of traders who will be holding over the weekend.

The sense in this, or whether or not it is equitable, is beside the point – it’s simply something you must be aware of as a forex trader.

If you want to avoid paying 3x interest, you could close your position before Wednesday’s close and re-enter once the new day begins and spreads settle down.  On the other hand, profiting on the 3x interest may be a little harder with a short term trade due to the wide spreads at this time of day – if you are entering a position to earn swap before the day ends, you should be happy to hold the position for at least an hour, as spreads may be wider than the swap you received at the start of the trading day.","self","https://redd.it/m30wjm"

From what I understand I need  change the price line to ASK or BID (instead of MID) to see a more reliable representation of how far away my TP is with spread included.

I know that this is obvious but currency price fluctuates forming HH, HL, LH, and LL. You should look at the market this way and decide whether the price is forming a HH or a LL. This works on all timeframes.
2. You have to know each peer's daily and weekly range. This will help you regarding what to expect in terms of movement. So if the price usually ranges from 50 to 200 Pips per week you should expect that movement. This will help you set a timeframe for the candles to form.
3. Include the fundamentals in your trading strategy, even if it's just a little. Of course, I am talking for the technical traders. And the same goes for fundamental traders.
4. Price has to retrace at some point. A good strategy would be to sell if the price moves up and into an oversold area and sell more if the price continues to go up until it goes down and you make a profit.
5. Trade using probabilities. If you are 90% sure that the peer will move in a certain direction open a larger position. And if you are 50% sure, make it smaller, and so on.
6. And last but not least, don't trade every day. Opportunities are few and far in between. Make sure to enter when there is a high probability.","self","https://redd.it/m3fapj"

Hello traders, here what the EBC yesterday decided and said moving forward

&#x200B;

ECB statement:

Rates left unchanged (expected)

Size of PEPP envelope unchanged (expected), purchases continue to end Mar 22 (unchanged)

EURUSD modestly weaker and Dax bid stronger

&#x200B;

Christian Lagarde speech :

ECB not bound by any specific number on PEPP, we want to deliver on our commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions. We are not bound by any specific number.

• Next Monday don't expect big PEPP rise

• The decision on purchase pace is taken by total consensus.

• ECB will see through temporary inflation rise

• Lists German vat, HICP weightings, Italy and France clothing sales & oil as reasons.

• Long-term inflation expectations remain subdued

• Inflation pick-up is mostly due to transitory factors.

• Not doing yield-curve control

• Risks have become more balanced mutations are source of downside risk

• Will continue to monitor exchange rates

• Financing conditions include risk-free rates and corporate borrowing costs among others.

• Market rates pose risk to wider financing conditions, rates could lead to premature tightening - preserving favourable financing conditions essential

&#x200B;

Interesting that this year's growth was revised up from December, however, 2022 sees slightly weaker and 2023 remains flat. 2021 Inflation saw a big revision up from December's forecasts, but Lagarde emphasized transitory nature of it and that longer-term price pressure will remain subdued

GBP - As the UK had 2 hard lockdowns for almost 2-3 months I expect the report of the Q4 to be a negative sentiment also today we had news about Manufacturing that they come out as negative. I expect the pound to be negative  this month.

USD - As the U.S. economy starts to reopen and the vaccine rollout is obviously a recovery for the Dollar.

Technically perspective: Today we saw a bear impulse on a strong resistance level at 1.40, what it means actually is the price has changed the direction.

I expect the price to broke the grey area and to continue the future this month.

IF OF COURSE, THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS NOT BUYING  ANY MORE BONDS TO STIMUL THE ECONOMY, THE BONDS PURCHASES WOUL'D BE RELEASE NEXT WEEK, WE CAN SEE BY THAT AN BULL  IMPULS IF NOT WE CAN SEE THE OPPOSITE.

I took this buy position on audusd this afternoon.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2olgbuv9vmm61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a282d3847d88e445879748242fe88d7245e5957

I had this demand zone marked and price entered it. The bottom darker grey zone is the sweet spot so although price didn't go as low as I would have liked for an entry, it did kiss the top and so I took the buy.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vd642ikrvmm61.png?width=2220&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d7bf9a7ec96b0d684ba5e9c3210c9b2a69e6fdc

Price hit the first TP pretty quickly so the trade is now essentially risk free as the loss would be less than the profit already taken. It also means I can relax a bit and try to leave the trade alone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cmh1wtx1wmm61.png?width=2220&format=png&auto=webp&s=5daf105b92e03d673a5271fc1d84de695d452396

There was a lot of downward movement after this which I thought might happen, looks scary but closer inspection shows more signals for my trade.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m3f9yu69wmm61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=b565020ac5e3d4b015f52a1312f06c27caad1ae4

This shows a nice wick into the sweet spot zone I had marked before. In hindsight a limit order here would have been ideal. Another entry would also have been good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uan7kmmhwmm61.png?width=2220&format=png&auto=webp&s=995ca1627e72dc5a89e9057444573c404ecb576b

Closed the trade here, didn't quite reach TP. It might soon, but it touched the bottom of this hourly supply so it could start reversing. It's Friday evening now and I decided to take the profit and enjoy the rest of the afternoon rather than wait anxiously for this to continue. I also prefer to not hold over the weekend. A decent RR was still achieved and risk was kept to a minimum. 

I hope this might be of help to some of you! Any comments/criticisms  are welcome

\-Up 2R before it reversed, at resistance I’d noted prior

&#x200B;

This has been one of my best weeks yet. I posted a few days ago regarding the reversals after 2R, and there’s work to do so I can decide if change is necessary. I'm confident I have an edge regardless so I’m not worried.

I've thought about tracking the pullback depth, with the retracement tool, to try and identify any patterns. A concern is that pullbacks need context - strong moves have shallow pullbacks. I need to give this more thought, and it is also not a priority right now.  
I’ve missed trades in the morning… Not really due to my trading, but rather because I’m a teenager, with sleep demands... Trading also doesn’t feel ‘real’ to me - I have zero reliance on it and often prefer extra sleep to the potential for a tiny amount of $. 

I’m aiming for 15R per month by September, to get an FTMO or 5%ers account. I’ll have to build a track record by getting out of bed, but as I say, this is a ‘me problem’, not my trading. :(

Thanks for the read! Please, any feedback would be appreciated and I'll try my best to answer any questions you may have :)","self","https://redd.it/m3od68"

I started trading in early November and had a $300 loss right away and then got into a demo account and have been honing my skill. 2 weeks ago I started a real account again and with $500 this time. The picture below has been my journey so far. My question is, why does this look so easy? I mean, I understand the risks and always have stop losses and trailing stops. At this rate, I could have 100k+ but next March.

I don't have any bots or anything. It's just plain old technical trading. Mostly make money on support and resistance areas. I just find it too easy at the moment and am actually worried that I'm not seeing something. What do y'all think?

When you  want to withdraw they increase your account balance(example: Mine was 7k  before my withdrawal date, once the withdrawal date comes the balance  suddenly jumps to 25k.

Highly confident traders don’t take the easy road.

They know that the things that are scary to do, are often what’s needed to succeed as a trader. For example…

When a trade is going your way, the easy thing to do is to get out of the trade for a measly premature profit.

The scary thing to do, is to hold onto the trade until it hits your take profit level, knowing that it could turn around and hit your stop loss.

Unfortunately, you need to do the latter. This way you’ll not only follow your trading strategy but you’ll also bank a bigger profit which is what you need to achieve for your portfolio.

Don’t bank a small profit just because you’re afraid of the trade turning against you. Small losses are all part of the trading game. It’s the big profits that will drive your portfolio higher.

Put in your trading levels (entry, stop loss and take profit) and simply leave your trade alone.

## “They don’t live in a bubble of comfort”

Taking a loss is probably one of the hardest things you can do as a trader. You simply don’t want to be wrong. New traders decide to not follow their own stop loss rules when they trade.

When a market is going against them they tend to drop the stop loss further down to avoid that uncomfortable feeling of taking a loss. They hold onto the losing trade which increases their losses to come.

This gives them some form of comfort knowing they aren’t wrong yet as they’re still holding onto their trade.

When you hold onto a loser, you feel like you still have hope and comfort with the trade. You believe the market will turn up where you’ll ‘eventually’ bank a decent profit.

The problem is if the market keeps dropping, that bubble of comfort is going to turn into a very painful experience when you take that knock. So make sure you cut your small loss and move onto the next one.

## “They don’t obsess over the opinions of others”

When you have a proven trading strategy, with a set amount of rules, everything else doesn’t matter.

Don’t worry about what Bloomberg, your friends or news articles are saying about local or international markets. These external opinions have nothing to do with the performance of your trading strategy.

If it did, then you would have included them into the rules.

So instead, follow your strategy as it is and forget the rest. You’ll feel more confident as a trader when you depend on less irrelevant resources.

## “They don’t need constant reassurance”

Confident people aren’t in need of hand holding.

You don’t need to ask anyone their opinion on what they think about your current trading positions.

Remember, when you have a trading strategy with proven results – YOU KNOW BETTER.

## “They don’t quit because of minor set-backs”

When incurring losses after a losing streak, confident traders keep at it.

They don’t throw away their strategy, break their keyboard and run back to the dusty drawing board.

No! A confident trader will first lower their risk per trade from say 2% down to 1%.

They’ll then re-analyse and go over their trading strategy again to see why the trading strategy isn’t performing as well as they expected it to.

Confidence comes with independence, the more you have your trading strategy in order, tried and tested – the more confident you’ll be as a trader for your financial future.","self","https://redd.it/m3refj"

You’ll find that self-reflection and self-preparation is all it takes to join the 5% of successful traders out there.

Today’s article is going to be a lot of fun, because I need you to help me.

I want you to write down these 5 traits on a piece of paper and rate yourself out of 10 (1 being lowest and 10 being highest) what level you’re on…

The higher the level, the better you’re suited to trading success.

If you find that you your results are at a low level, then make sure you keep reading *BlackStone Futures* newsletters in the next few weeks because I’ll be helping you develop the mind of a successful trader.

Let’s get to them…

* **GUTS**

First you need the guts to do the most basic thing.

To break the inertia and take the guts to open a trading account.

You can’t make a reward without a little risk. And so to do so, set aside some money you can happily use on a holiday and open an account with a trading broker instead.

Once you’ve opened an account, you can deposit R500, R1,000 or even R10,000 what ever you can afford to risk.

Then you’re ready to take your first trade.

So are you ready to open a trading account? If “YES” mark 10 on the piece of paper. If “NO” then mark 0…

* **DISCIPLINE**

Second we’re onto discipline.

Answer “yes” or “no” so we can see what level of discipline you’re at…

Do you have the DISCIPLINE to:

1. Get up every morning turn on your computer and trade for a few minutes?
2. Look for trading setups every day so you can let the market do its thing while you’re away?
3. Bank a gain or a loss when the trade hits either your take profit or your stop loss level?
4. Never risk more than what you can afford to lose per trade?
5. Do this every single week for the rest of your trading career?
6. Follow your trading strategy with strict entry, reward and risk levels?
7. Prepare a room for your trading where you’ll go every day to analyse and look for high profit trades?
8. Not give up on trading after a small losing streak?
9. Not go against your strategy?

Every “yes’’ answer will give you one point… Then write down DISCIPLINE on your piece of paper and add up the number of ones to see the level you’re at in this case

Moving on… 

* **PATIENCE**

Third, you need to understand how important it is to be patient enough to discern a buying moment and a selling moment.

You need to know WHEN to buy and sell what I call a high probability trade.

You’ll need patience to wait for a trade to line up according to your strategy and not just rush into taking a trade for the sake of it.

Most loser traders’ think they’re better than their strategy and so they just take trades because of how they feel a market will go.

It’s reasons like these why they put a bad name to trading.

How patient are you? This seems to be a bit more subjective as you know yourself better. And so write down your level of patience down…

* **INDEPENDENCE**

Now this is an important one…

Successful trading, unfortunately and fortunately, is a LONE ranger game.

Everything you do and decide is all down to you and your strategy.

You should not depend on anyone…

With this trait, I want you to start at 10 points and with every “YES” answer, I want you to subtract a point.

Then you’ll know what level of INDEPENDENCE you’re at.

Let’s go…

When you trade will you listen to the opinions from your:

1. Friends
2. Family
3. TV
4. Your irrational feelings
5. Dog or cat
6. Magazines
7. Radio
8. Colleagues
9. Random person
10. Spouse?

Write your level of independence down now…

Independence is crucial in order to be a successful trader.

1. **MONEY**

You need money to make money.

And let me tell you something about that last point – It’s true, but only partly.

Because, yes, money is necessary… But what they are hiding is that  you  DO NOT need thousands of dollars to make money.

You can start with little… Very little.

In fact, you can get you started trading local, international markets and currencies with just $100.

So this one is easy…

If you have $100 to trade give yourself a rating of 10 under money. If you don’t have $100 then simply put 0.

### How’s your score?

If your score is looking pretty good and high already then it sounds like you’re probably ready to start banking a good income from the markets.","self","https://redd.it/m3rj4h"

Put half your nut into abra stablecoins, earning 10% APY, and then put the other half into shorting the USD, but at 50:1 leverage, so you’ve got a lot of maintenance margin. You’re completely hedged on currency price movement, and can reallocate when you’re getting too big. 

Either sell the gains from the short to put into the interest earning account, or transfer out of the interest account to cover the spot fx hedge.

Entered this GU sell yesterday and went breakeven right after the big drop.

Had to drive for 2 hours after that, so I set my alert at 1.38632, which was my target for a 1:10R.  There I would have taken off 50% if not the whole position and trail my SL tighter... Unfortunately as you can see it reversed right before my alert, so when I looked at the position after my drive, it took me out at BE...hence the name of the post

Not even a pip was the difference between a 10R and a BE trade... if I was at the charts I would have taken it off without the alert, but you cant be sitting there all the time right?

Onto the next I suppose...","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mrZytnH8FtW6t8t8t8KGfRRCrJbMQLi_cRSZ80OzRiw.jpg","https://redd.it/m48q22"

Weekly trade Idea on USD/CHF

### Week: 15-19.03.2021

## Key event: USD. Interest Rate Decision

A rate hike tends to boost the local currency, as it is understood as a sign of a healthy inflation. A rate cut, on the other hand, is seen as a sign of economic and inflationary woes and, therefore, tends to weaken the local currency. If rates remain unchanged, attention turns to the tone of the FOMC statement, and whether the tone is hawkish, or dovish over future developments of inflation.\*\*

**We expect a similar reading to the previous month.**

## Until release day, we expect a continuation of the actual trend. A surprising data value could reverse the actual trend direction.

## Key Levels:

* Resistance 0.9460\*\*
* Support 0.9200, 0.9090, 0.9020\*\*

## Trend USD/CHF:

**Bullish**

**Price has surged and forming HH and HL, which could be the start of a new uptrend. It has formed new demand levels visible on lower Time Frames.**

## Call to Action/Trade Idea

**We will look to buy near supports and demand zones, with targets on resistance 0.9460.**

Pairs I trade = EUR/USD, GBP/USD and GBP/JPY

Risk per trade = 0.10%, 0.20%, 0.30% or 0.40%

SL = Depends (5 pips, 10 pips or 25 pips)

Now, I am asking all this is because I have entered second stage of evaluation with a prop firm and the leverage has been dropped from 1:10 to 1:3

My question is **if my leverage is 1:3 then what is the max position size I can use. Please help me with an easy way to find this**

My Risk per trade is not fixed but anywhere below 0.50% (0.20%, 0.30 or 0.40)

My SLs are anywhere between 5-20 pips that way I can aim for a High RR (4-10x)

All the articles are so confusing with standard lots, mini lots etc… Why does the forex world give so much weightage to pips when there are 5 decimals in reality? 4 decimals were used by old school brokers

Now, I don’t bother to know all this because normally before placing a trade I decide my SL.  
Then I divide my risk amount/ pips (Been trading from years)

If leverage is low as 1:3 then — **Is it better to take multiple 1:1 or 1:2 RR trades or place few trades with high RR ratio** ?","https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/OQBW0a5V7Ir-An5Hwf0RYOS5kST_TUku7t3Yl6Rt3KE.jpg","https://redd.it/m4rcpg"

Last week was very busy but largely uneventful in terms of gain/loss.

As predicted, after a decent week 1, the system regressed somewhat and produced a return of -1.66%.

From the equity curve, you can see that the account dipped from +4.56% to around +1.46% by midweek. This is where I assume most people would have probably jumped to another system but backtested results give you that extra courage to continue. The following couple of days saw a return to normal for the system and we ended at -1.66% for the week.Not bad at all.

System currently sits at 60% winrate with a 0.91 RR which is below backtesting results so hopefully we will see a movement upward toward the mean which should be around 65% WR and 0.93 RR.

Happy trading for the upcoming week everyone

However this correction gave us a possible formation of head and shoulders. If the price does not react upwards in the area of formation of the right shoulder, then it can be directed towards the reversal area of SL 2 at 0.92315.

The trend even at this low level remains upward. Upward targets are strong and achievable.

I will be involved in a long trade either after the reaction at the level of the first SL or at the level of the second SL. The market will show us.

New to the forex game. I know chart patterns and some TA from stocks and crypto trading. 

What is a realistic monthly return? I see some people talking about 10x'ing in a month. Others saying 10%. And still others saying 1-2% monthly. 

I want to know this so I go in with the right expectations. I've entered markets before with the wrong expectations, and it destroyed my accounts until my expectations met reality. 

Another question, what is a good risk/reward set up and how often should my trades win? 

For example, is a safe setup 3:1 @ 30% win rate? In this example, if I won $3 on my winning trades, but lost $1 on my losers, I could lose 7/10 trades and still make $2. (Numbers here are arbitrary for theoretical purposes) Is this realistic?

My total Win % from those \~4000 trades is 51% wins. I have been consistently  profitable in all my main markets (SP500, EURUSD, NASDAQ, DOW JONES) every year. Heres a quick FAQ with answers, based on my own experience. Ive made this because i would have loved to have seen this myself when i was a new trader. Hope this helps someone.

&#x200B;

1. **Can i become rich and quit my dayjob?** \- Short answer is 99,98% chance of No. Look at this as a fun hobby that might end up costing you a few K's or making you a few K's and if you get really really good then maybe you can get alot of K's. But first you should just focus on not loosing money. Rich is something you become if your already a great trader for many years.
2. **Whats the smallest amount of money i can start with?** \- You can start with very little money (like 1000$), but if your next 2-3 trades are loosers its most likely going to be hard on your account unless you treat it with the respect it deserves.
3. **How much should i risk on each trade?** \- 1-2% of your account is sort of the standard answer your going to get. More than that and you will quickly blow your account. When you eventually hit a 5-10 loss in a row, which you are going to experience sooner or later, you will be glad you only lost 5-10% of your account and not 50-100%. Of course this will turn your profits into much smaller gains, but risk reward is not something to be played with. Loosing money is the first step to becoming broke.
4. **Ive tried everything and its not working! Should i give up??** \- Trading is not easy, if it was then everyone would be doing it. CFD brokers report that 75% of all retail traders consistently loose money each year. You need to be in the top 25% just to become profitable. And remember that Profitable does not mean rich... It just means you can keep trading..
5. **Can i make money buying any EA / bot / tradingprogram / strategy / courses??** \- in 999/1000 times, the short answer is no. Imagine if you create this amazing strategy that gets you amazing 10% returns per week, would you SELL that?? Even just selling the information of when the entry/exit is, could be enough information for people to reverse engineer your AMAZING system..Fuck selling it for 50$ am i right? You would honestly just keep trading it until your a millionaire and then some... All that said i think courses that are general are at least better than courses that teach some holy grail strategy that probably dosnt work.
6. **I got this amazing profitable system, now i just need alot of money/get funded, then i can become rich, right??** \- No. People think if your profitable for 6 months or 100 trades profitable in total or whatever milestone they have set, they are going to be profitable forever. Also people who have 1000$ accounts always say things like ""if I just had a 100K account I would be rich!"", truth is that if your profitable in the long run, you will become a millionaire by just trading that 1000$ account... Dont start dreaming about ""getting funded"" etc. Its mostly smoke and mirrors. What you need is YEARS of stable returns, that will get you ""funded"" the way you would want to be funded: with your own money.
7. **What is a ""trading strategy""?** \- It can be anything. It can be the higher highs or the lower lows, it can be the MACD, the RSI or the time of the day, or a combination of all of the above. It can be fundemental, sentimental, technical. The most important thing however. And this is very important boys and girls. The strategy needs to be REPEATABLE. If you can repeat a profitable trade over and over again, you got yourself a strategy. When you need to repeat something, you often need to define ""it"" is and how to do ""it"". In other words: Whats the rules and reasons that you did the trade you just did? Can you define the rules down to every little bit? If you define the rules, you can start to TEST your system. And then you can see if your system is actually good or crap. Without testing a system you dont really know if its working or not. 10 profitable trades in a row means nothing when you going to do 1000 trades on that same system over the years, and the same goes for 10 losses in a row, dosnt have to mean your system is broken.
8. **What is ""money management""?** \- Another word for money management would have to be ""risk"". How much are you willing to risk and how much would that affect your account? Making sure that your account does not blow up should be your number one concern. I think the vast majority of traders have blown an account or two, and by doing that they (hopefully) start managing their money in a more careful way, making sure the account does not blow up again.
9. **How much should i expect to earn? -** If you have 1000$ account and make another 1000$, then you got 100% return on your account. You might think youre a god amongst traders. The key thing here tho is consistency. How often are you able to pull of 100% returns? Because if you can make 100% every month for 10 years you are most likely one of the richest men on earth. However if look at what realistic earnings look like, then you should be happy with +1% per year and you should work every day to get more without risking your whole account in the process. If you can go from 1% -> 10% then thats amazing progress. Personally with the systems im running im hoping for 20-60+% yearly returns knowing that a fat red year would probably look like -20% to -25% for me as the worst case scenario.
10. **I have watched every youtube video about trading, im ready for sure now! -** Youtube videoes are created to get clicks. Catchy thumbnails and names like ""pro trader academy"" might draw in new traders that eventually might buy their courses. If you think that watching 10 hours of youtube videoes on trading could get you rich then your wrong.

&#x200B;

Some final words

1. If you are down -50% you need to earn +100% just to break even.
2. Pro's are looking for 10-30% per year. The average your going to get in the SP500 long run (correct me if im wrong) is like 7-8% yearly return. This leads me back to the #9 - treat your account as if its 100x bigger. Dont expect 100++% returns if your going to have a reasonable risk reward/money managemnt.
3. If you dont loose money trading, your going to earn money.
4. Others cant tell you how to trade, you have to figure it out yourself and put in the hours it takes.
5. There are TONS of research and books and podcasts out there. Google WHATEVER topic in trading that interest you + the word ""book"" and you will probably find thousands of pages that should interest you. Youtube will only cover the basics. Learning how to trade from A-Z from youtube alone will most likely not make you a profitable trader in the long run
6. You will not find many answers on reddit.
7. Quitting your dayjob to trade is probably one of the dumbest things you can do. Even if you got a profitable strategy, just trade it when you can  or automate it, and pay the bills with your dayjob.
8. Trading is a lonely game. You will often have noone else to lean on for advice or what to do in a stressful situation. When it goes great, it feels good to go brag about your winnings on a forum or post on reddit. This is a trap created by your ego to make yourself feel good. Try to ignore this voice in your head as it may lead to you making bad decisions based on arrogance. The same goes for when your trading is going badly. Losing trades are extra painful because its a whole lot of ""shouldve wouldve couldve"" scenarios thats going to replay in your head. ""if only you had done this or that"".. As long as you follow your strategy its a good trade even if its a looser.
9. People/funds/firms/prop firms/banks are trading for a living every day. You are trying to take their money. Its not going to be easy.

Good luck and happy trading.

The ECB, unsurprisingly, made no material changes to the current monetary policy. The bank did commit to ramping up the pace of their Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme yet overall, the size of bond purchasing will remain the same. The policy stance has always been non-exchange rate targeting and the ECB kept to that commitment, as the latest move is not expected to dampen support for the Eurodollar. 

Annualized inflation is moving closer to the Fed’s price stability mandate of 2%. In the 12 months to February, consumer prices climbed 1.7%. A surge in energy prices contributed the most to the rise in the index, however, consumer-related services continue to suffer from a lack of demand. The result marks a steady recovery, highlighting that growth in the world’s third largest economy continues to be asymmetric. The approval of Biden’s $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package should stoke consumer demand and that, coupled with a ramp up in the vaccination programme, should result a more rapid economic recovery. 

China’s trade balance data indicated a strong recovery as the region rang in the new year. Exports jumped 61% in January and February compared with a contraction 17% during the same period of 2020. Sentiment in Japan climbed in February, according to the Economy Watchers Survey. Businesses are more optimistic about future economic prospects with the index climbing over 10% month-on-month.","self","https://redd.it/m5c681"

However when i place for example a trade risking only £2 I am told i have insufficient margin. Of course i never had this problem trading demo. I am very confused and so far have only been able to place trades £1 or under, sometimes even then I cannot and am told i have insufficient margin. Finding it very fustrating as this of course means my profits are incredibly small( managed to scalp a mere £3, after many under £1 trades.) Any limit orders also get cancelled once price triggers them(or tries) with the same insufficient margin message. Also get a margin callout warning message (you are withing 2.5% of a margin closeout) after placing these tiny trades-(e.g a 90p trade i placed) which im assuming as the message says will cancel open position if margins fall beyond a certain point. Very confused as even if the trade went cometely again me and hit my SL i still would only loose a very small % of my account. I did try to increase my margin on my OANDA account to 1:100 however this still did not seem to help. The order info section at the bottom of the tradingview order panel also still says 1:30. Im not sure if this is fixed to the pair i am trading, Only trading EUR/USD- just as i did on demo and when backtesting. Also i am sure the fixed leverge for this pair should be 1:50. Either way whatever the issue, or my own misunderstanding, is I hope someone will be able to help.

Basically always get insufficient margin message even when risking not even 5% of the available balance.

Also not sure if it is relevant to add that i am (or trying to) scalp. Using 1m- 15m mainly. If the issue were to revolve around this it would be very complicated for me as this is the strategy that has worked for me via demo and backtesting. Therefore definitely would not want to start trying swinging or even intraday as it is simply not something I have spent hours a day learning, testing and puttong into practice. Likely i would not be profitable if i tried to start a whole new style of trading because of this issue

Sorry for the lengthy post just very, very confused and fustrated( not necessarily because I am not trading as successfully as i wanted to but more so that i do not understand why). It is kind of discouraging at the moment however, I am determined to understand the problem and solution so i may properly begin my forex live account journey. This is especially important for me as I planned to deposit a larger amount after increasing my experience on a live account. As someone who wishes to enter the 'realm' of professional traders by my 20's this is an issue I must overcome.","self","https://redd.it/m5h6y4"

But what push my button is why 1,2 but not 2.5? not 5? not 10? where is the limit? Now I have dig a little deeper in my hole mathematically and statistically (just basic) and want to provide a glance on what could be possible theoretically.

For everyone that compounding the account, since the account size change based on previous amount with relative %. It would just be multiplication, therefore commutative. For example, 1000 to 1020 is 2% increase, 1040.2 from 1020 is also 2% or 1000\*(1+2%)\*(1+2%). The reason I go through this point is to eliminate possibility of very large draw down or very lucky winning streak. That means it doesn't matter if I lose 20 trades in a row or win 20 in a row, as long at my average yield positive result. 5 win then 5 lose yield the same as 1 lose then 1 win repeat 5 times.

The formula below only apply for simple RR system (like 3RR with 36%?).

I use basic setting, 3 RR and somewhat realistic win rate of 36%, and calculate average compound return % with respect to risk per trade (Figure 1).

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/hqhnnfqnd7n61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=60982e148fd96934c65095101169fdfc04dd3f2e)

Now it seems like the more I risk, the more average return increase. However up to a point where the more I risk, the less I earn. well I calculate that point for easy reference (Figure 2):

[Figure 2](https://preview.redd.it/kus5iycge7n61.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=2934d687ba4d85bc1c82bcf3ba008394ce2b173c)

In this specific example, I can risk up to 14% per trade before sabotage myself. However it is not ideal to just follow stuff calculated on paper. The win rate might not be correct, haven't take to account commission, etc...

So does that means these can just go to the trash? not really. There is uncertainty in what is your true win rate look like and I like to pin it with confidence interval. The more sample size, the more certain and precise that your win rate is, just never be 100%.

https://preview.redd.it/edkek5euf7n61.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ece149acea021f0f505efc38dd9f421c442dfae

I figure if the stats collected consistently, then the 36% within 100 samples turn out to be roughly 36% +- 9.6%. To be sure, I will just assume the system has 26.4% win rate, and this will put saturated risk at 1.84%. And voila, we know what is the max risk we could take every trade now.

I think I come to conclusion that until there is some certain in the trading system, minimal risk should be taken. Once system has been tested to be falling in safe zone, maximum risk can be taken accordingly (up to lowest win rate possible). SO it is possible to grow account very very fast if you know what you are doing. I welcome you to fix me if I'm wrong as I am still learning and practicing in this market.

Side discussion: I have seen many people refer to big boys yield 10-30% or comparing to some indices was a good return and I have to admit they are really really good.

This has absolutely nothing to do with my degree and I’m ready to chase my dreams. As much as I love to travel, I hate the timeshare industry and these ridiculous job performance standards my job has placed on us to sell during a pandemic. It’s unrealistic and I’m tired of the stress. I want to work full time on crafting my dreams but of course I still need to make money to live. A couple people I know are living completely solo off of Forex alone. I am interested in knowing more on how to get started, I want to be one of them. I am tired of working for the man and want to have disposable income to travel and invest in my passion/dreams.

You will have good days and bad days , so it all depends on how your set and reach your Goals.

Let use this example :

You deposit $30 000 into your Trading account.

You set a realistic 15% monthly profit goal.

You will make approximately ($4500) per month.

The more you invest back into your account , the more you can profit.

HERE IS MY SECRET RECIPE:

My weekly & monthly goals I set out for myself to succeed, and it worked for me for the past 9 years:

If I make 2% in a day, that will be a good day of trading and I will resume the next day.

6% a week and 18% a month.

I Risk .5 - 1% of my total portfolio per trade, setting a risk-reward ration of 1:2 per trade. This means you’ll make $2 for every $1 you’ll risk.

If the Risk-Reward is less than 1:2 on a trade, I don't take the trade and will wait for a better opportunity to come up.

Let's say I open some trades and within an hour or two, I see the combined profit of 0.5% of my total account (irregardless of profit or loss on individual pairs), if I close all those trades then should I feel guilty of breaking risk management principles?

For example, I open 20 trades with risk of 0.25% per trade (total risk of 5% of account) and after an hour if see cummulative profit of 0.5% of total account then is it not better to close all the trades at once and call it a day?

I know that I am settling for 0.5% of the account risking 5% of the account and even if I am wrong 1 out of 10 days I will end up in a loss. But at the same time I am not blindly opening the trades and there is some strategy behind it and the risk is so diverse that it is very difficult to lose all 20 trades at once.

**1) During FTMO challenge, you need to make 10% profit in under 30 calendar days.**

Anyone who has been trading forex for a while knows that 10% profit in a month is actually not that easy unless you get lucky /have a really good month or take a lot higher risk percentage than you should.

When  I did finish my ftmo challenge on my main account, it took me 20 out of 22 total trading days in that month and I still count myself as lucky to even be able to achieve it.  If my trading system was off even by a little bit and end up taking a few losses for just two more days, then I would never have finished my challenge.

So, remember this. If you're making 10% of your account in one or two trading days then either you're really lucky or you are taking huge risks . The latter is the most likely guess.  It will bite you one day in the future because , well, you will be coming across days where anything you touch will end up being a loss for you. Any trader who traded for an year or so in forex at minimum knows that bad days are just inevitable at one point and is part of the job.

**2) I have come across Youtube videos and posts where some Ftmo traders who finished the challenge propose some wacky risk management techniques and tricks just to finish the challenge.**

My opinion? Some of them do work and you can get away with it.  But here's the thing.

\-You can get away this month, finish challenge and verification.

\-Maybe get away next month too and make 10% or so that month.

But how long is it really sustainable? All it takes is just one or few bad days in a row for you to breach either the daily loss or the max loss.  Your ftmo account will be closed and you'll be back at square one.  All of this ends up as something you did to make a few bucks .

**Final thoughts:**  I'm happy that a lot of people are passing the evaluation and getting funded by ftmo.   It's not easy, I know. Just pay very close attention to your risk management and make sure you don't ruin everything you worked for during a few inevitable bad days.","self","https://redd.it/m63byd"

Let's say my base currency is CAD. 

Portfolio:

\-50k CAD

\-50k USD

\+100k USD stocks

Let's say I 10k sell usd, buy cad (usd.cad) @ 1.4

\-60k usd

\-36k cad

Intuitively it seems I made a gain on cad if my cost basis of the original -50k usd was less than 1.4 (say it was 1.3). gain of $1000 cad (1.4x10k - 1.3x10k)

Now let's say I 10k buy usd, sell cad (usd.cad) @ 1.25

\-50k usd

\-48.5 k cad

What is the situation here? is it an unrealized addition to cost basis of the usd funds? Originally was 1.3  for 50k usd, now i add 10k to that @ 1.25 or (50/60 \* 1.3 + 10/60 \* 1.25) for 1.2916.

Or should I realize this as a loss/gain as well mark to market?

Is this correct or is the sign backwards relative to cad? i can imagine also paying down or increasing the usd loan so not sure if i have a gain or loss relative to cad!

My intuition says it doesn't matter if its margin or not, the direction is the same either way so gains are gains with loans and losses are losses with loans also.

Any input on this? the worst thing i can imagine is to not know if you have a gain or loss for taxes and to pay tax on a loss!","self","https://redd.it/m65e06"

Hello,
I would like to share with you a great indicator for exiting a trend I found. I am a developer and I have backtested various methods for exiting a trade - indicators divergences, Elliott waves, trailing stop, fixed profits, etc. I think the best thing which I found is this method and it is very simple.

Using the Ichimoku indicator you exit the trade immediately when the lagging span crosses the price high or low. On a long trade you want the price high to cross from below to above the lagging span and this is when you get out. For short position it is of course the opposite.

It is logical that you can and should also use this indicator to filter your entries and never enter a trade if the price has already crossed the lagging span from this direction as this means the trend is loosing momentum.

One important thing to note is that the lagging span is actually the current price shifted 26 bars in the past. Which means that it never exists in the present moment on the chart, only in the past. So if you look at the past chart and you see where the price has crossed the lagging span you should assume that you should have not exited then, but 26 bars ahead of this moment.

I hope this helps someone.
Greetings","self","https://redd.it/m6eom5"

You’d probably need to grasp the concept of what is a pip in forex \[percetange in point\].

These days most brokers quote forex pairs to 5 decimal places, but in the past just 4 decimal places were common – *a pip is the 4th decimal* place in your currency pair quote, whilst a point/pipette *is the 5th*.

**Simple terms for beginners!**

For a pair like USDJPY which is generally quoted to just 3 decimal places, the *second decimal is the pip* and the third is the point/pipette.

Pips are necessary due to the amount of leverage used in the forex market, a seemingly small number of pips can be worth quite a lot of money once levered using leverage provided by your broker.

**What is a Pip in Forex and How Much is 1 Pip Worth To You?**

**Forex Pip Example Explained**

Let’s look at an example of a forex pip on the EURUSD crosses:

* EURUSD is trading at 1.11560
* It rises by one pip to 1.11570
* It falls by six pips to 1.11510

On the USDJPY crosses:

* USDJPY is trading at 105.650
* It rises by one pip to 105.660
* It falls by six pips to 105.590

Because the YEN is such a weak currency and can easily be 105 or even 115 Yen for 1 USD it is quoted with 2 decimals and the third being the point/pipette.

The price of the Yen fluctuates a lot, in big numbers, removing the need for 4 decimals.

The Yen is normally the quote currency, known as the counter currency, which is the second currency in the currency pair, determining the value of the base currency.","https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/C3IfwXWCXB3X63X4uuISIoFzD946AI95iqR6edJAYI4.jpg","https://redd.it/m6i0l3"

I didn’t give it much thought at first, but then I started to watch the posts made by the members of this community and I began seeing things that made no sense to me: people posting trades with 20:1, 50:1 and even 100:1 reward to risk ratios. All of them claimed to have learned from this community, and since there were a ton of them, it was getting less and less likely that they were all part of the same group of scammers.

Curiosity got the best of me and I joined. What did I have to lose? At worse I lose a bit of money to the subscription, but at best I’ll become a millionaire in a few months!

The course provided went over the hot stuff of the moment: liquidity zones, order blocks, manipulation and “smart money” concepts. You’ve heard this before, but I wasn’t phased by it much at all. You can actually be profitable trading these things, because they are nothing more than a rephrase of supply/demand and support and resistance - both of which can give you an edge if you know what you’re doing.

I don’t like people who teach this stuff because it is misleading, as it makes you believe you know how institutions trade, when in reality you have no clue. But as long as you’re making people profitable, I take no issue with you.

What I take issue with is another thing that scared the shit out of me about this community. It’s something I have never seen before and I know for certain that, once this becomes more known, more educators will start doing the same, and so many people will fall for it. They call them **case studies**. Let me explain how this works.

You join my community. You go through the course content, you study it and you wait until you’re confident about what you’ve learned.

Once you are confident, instead of backtesting, I will advice you to do a case study on a market that you like. A case study is a reverse backtest: **you look for a successful trade FIRST, and you find a reason for entry AFTER you see how it plays out**. 

I will ask you to curve fit this case study as much as you can: you will do so by going down to lower timeframes, looking for ideal points to place your stop loss - which is always going to be near the very top or bottom of the move you caught with the benefit of hindsight. You will 100% find a way to fool yourself that you would have placed your stop there - maybe there is an order block inside the larger order block, maybe there is structure. It’s so easy to justify anything when you know what’s going to happen.

This will make sense to you. I will explain to you that this exercises serves to teach you how to actually trade these setups in the live market.

Of course, you do the same with your target. The end result is a monumental trade with an insanely tight stop loss and a huge reward ratio.

What are you going to do after you complete your first case study? Well, you are probably as hard as a rock in your pants, and chances are you are going to go to your social media and post a screenshot of the trade you just “took”. Someone will see it, not knowing it was taken with the benefit of hindsight and curve fitted to obscene levels, and will join the community.

Rinse and repeat. Congratulations - you have just created a cult that will generate income for you and save you a ton in advertising expenses.","self","https://redd.it/m6i6b0"

So after a long day at work I decide to take a look at some forex charts, when I suddenly see this big drop in EURJPY. A drop of the same magnitude and at the same time can be found in EURUSD and EURAUD too. Logically, this has to do with the EUR. I found at [investing.com](https://investing.com) that at this time the Chair Andrea Enria from the ECB (European Central Bank) was... 'SPEAKING'...

I can't seem to find ANY footage of him speaking.

Now I wonder, what is it that he has announced that made the EUR drop so much? Or is it something else that I am missing?

Nevertheless, see how the price bounces beautifully on my trendline that I drew earlier. It also bounces on the 200H MA beautifully. I'm gonna go long on this one with a tight stop loss. If fundamentally everything has been processed in the price already, then I assume technically this will be a good trade, as it has been in a steady upchannel for a while now.

 I'm from the Caribbean so it's a bit difficult for me to save 1k or 2k to use it for trading, since it's basically my monthly salary (though I'm looking for new opportunities with higher salaries).  I'm currently using AdmiralMarkets, though its execution speed is not the best, it has somewhat low spreads and a good leverage ratio (up to 1:500). 

Since the new ASIC regulations force brokers  to reduce margins to 1:30 max, I'm looking for a broker that could offer at least 1:200 leverage and not based on Australia, so I can throw $50 or $100 at it and actually make trades as I'm currently doing.

GBP/USD","Fundamental Analysis",1.0,4,0,0,0,0,"As promised a few hours ago I will share my thoughts on the week. Only Hindsight today, will share an actual chart tomorrow for Thursday probably for New York Session don't know yet.

So what we see this week should already show you how the market moves when specific events happen at the right time. First I will show you a H1 Chart of the current week and discuss what I am seeing.

[H1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/5py6ccsmomn61.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=345c35b5f538b670ac53c249b4b5251952a928af)

So I wanna keep my charts clean and simple I think. It's useless if I have 10 Boxes 20 Lines and everybody is confused. I think I will outline the most important that just when you look at it you should understand what's going on. So I think it is already clear what I wanna explain today. Of course you can't act blindly on what I tell you here and just trade without looking at the chart. So what I am about to tell is not like a holy grail you should take for granted and just take trades with out question it critically. Especially in this business you are mostly on your on, but obviously it's never wrong to look into new things.

As you can see the London Session has been exactly the same for Tuesday and Wednesday and on both days there was a chance to make profits in New York session since London already gave us hints what direction NY will trade to. So the two lines shown in the chart are 1.) Low of the previous day (Monday Low) and 2.) High of Tuesday. So what do I look for before I even consider a Trade I want a High or Low being broken, because that's when the real and ""easy"" setups come around. As outlined Tuesday plays into our hands by breaking Mondays low during London session and on Wednesday it breaks the high of Tuesday during London session. Did I know that it will reverse during New York session as I saw the Low (Tuesday) or High (Wednesday) being broken?? No I did not \^\^ But I will show you when I did when I go more in depth on the Tuesday! So what you can take away here is that once a Low or High is broken the real profit setups form either in form of reversing or continuing.

Now we will go in depth of the Tuesday of this GBP/USD Chart!

[GBP\/USD M5](https://preview.redd.it/9aoz0n7ksmn61.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b52e35bd6700e7e2163a4b5c506f4fa5e0bbdbb)

I hope you can see shit on this image on my screen it looks scuffed right now, but hopefully it will be fine once I posted it. So Here I quickly explain what showed me that this is not a dump but a stop run that just happend in London session. A dump on H1 is a steady falling chart on low time frame, really rarely you see big black or green candles on M1 and M5 chart. Usually you will see a lot of lower lows or higher highs and working it's way up or down. So when am I convinced that the chart will turn. I start paying attention once a previous high is broken on lower time frame. As you can see here at the start of New York we break the most previous high that was created during the dump that happend in London. Right there I started to look for a long entry, which took place with the next M5 Candle. The 2 black Candles I outlined with the white box are now support for me! So once it trades inside of them I will go long. As showed on the chart it barely touches it with almost no draw down. From here you can decide the target and the Stop Loss yourself. Whatever you feel comfortable with.

So this would conclude my ""short"" thoughts on what happend so far this week. Usually on Thursday I make my most profits so I will probably share a chart either GBP or EUR before New York opens. :)

I hope this was informative and as said in my (Welcome back post) I don't wanna offend anyone who might trade a different style. I just wanna share my thoughts and try to help some people with it.

2) If you're in a trade regarding a pair during a three star event, then get out a few minutes earlier and wait for a while /let the market sort itself before entering back into your initial trade idea.

I salute bravery of those people who stay in their positions during big news events but , one bad move against you on one random news event and  market will not even respect your stop loss even if you have tight SL (ftmo/online prop  high risk traders I'm looking at you. I do know none of you have been there.)

I know it feels good to flex on some lucky random news event and being on the right side but for real? Good luck.

I have been trading FX for quite a while and never found that news event risks to be worth it at all. Anything 3 star in the forex pair I trade, I just stay away. I know you can make a lot of money but just the thought of being on the wrong side and being down 5-10% of account or so in a second on one fateful unlucky day is just not worth it at all for me.  **The potential insane profit is not worth the risk and pain you might endure.**

If you act smart and think you can try some ""techniques"" during news events, then I have no words.  Good luck outsmarting big banks.

&#x200B;

Edit: I know some of you dont understand why it doesn't work. You just cannot scalp news events like that in a few minutes like you do on your demo/prop accounts.  Your spread will be huge at the moment during the news event that any market order you place will be executed right at a ridiculous price level(limit order will rarely get executed at all). Secondly, any SL you use will not be respected because ""SL"" works on the basis of the best price your broker/bank can get. But during these situations, the best price they can get will be a really bad price for you because of the price jump during the news event under a second. So your SL will be automatically executed but at a really bad price if the market moves against you.

This does not make sense to me since only the daily timeframe has that break of 1 day. So lets say i am using the 1hr chart. There is no break in that original 26 period(26hr) settings.

i have decided to just stick with the original settings and they work just fine for me across all assets. and looking back at each settings side by side. They both seem to get you good trades but not the same good trades. with the original settings getting you into more trades. test was recent 1hr btcusd price action with doubled settings.

I am happy to continue trading the original settings but I really would like to get a better understanding of each setting. because it seems to me that the correct way to go about it would be custom settings for each timeframe.

There is a well known youtuber who quotes 'We win by not losing'. He's not wrong.  In my potentially futile pursuit to write profitable algos, I have had some success in filtering out some bad trades and was wondering if anyone would like to share some tips to identifying a bad entry when every other signal comes up millhouse.

I'll start.

1. Don't take a trade if the previous candle (the one prior to entry assuming your system trades the close) is larger than twice the ATR.
2. Times.  Don't trade mondays until 4 hours in to the london session and stop by friday about 4 hours in to the NY session.  On Tue-Thur, start 1 hour in to the London session and no more entries after 1 hour prior to NY close.  This doesn't apply of course if you trade some sort of London breakout gambit.
3. If your trade signal is a combination of indicators, don't take the trade if any of them have been a go for more than 5 or 6 candles.

I trade the 4hr and found these rules effective across most pairs and sp500 and dax.  Note these are the back-tested observations of one dude and may not apply to your strategy or style.  Don't talk to me about style.  I wear track pants to work.

Best.

I only opened an account this month, but I have been doing a lot of external reading a research for a number of months now. 

I used a demo account for a little bit, but for me (and I know this may not be the wisest method) the lack of risk involved caused me to not really pay proper attention to the trades I was taking or my risk management. I didn’t feel the lack of consequence was helping my learning, so I decided to start an account with a small amount of money (£300) that I was willing to risk. 

I am not yet in profit, slightly down on my initial investment, but i’m using proper risk management and trying to learn from every trade, wether its a loss or profitable. 

I have set myself the goal of growing this account to £1000 within a year. My question is, is this a reasonable goal for someone of my experience? Should I be aiming lower/ higher, extending the time period I wish to achieve this or lowering the account size target? 

On top of this, should I be adding funds to my account every now and then? Would it be beneficial to add perhaps £100 a month to help with trade sizes (I tend to use only micro lots atm) or should I stick with my initial investment and try to grow that set amount? 

Any tips/ suggestions/ advice would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone can suggest some good learning resources or mentors to learn from that would be awesome! 

I’m currently watching Rob Booker and No Nonsense forex on youtube and am reading through babypips ☺️","self","https://redd.it/m7p8ex"
