So of course, saving and investing became a big part of my life. Earlier this year however, something happened in my life and I decided to also start taking care of myself. Went on a diet, started exercising and have so far lost about 30 lbs.

I can now do 5K runs and I don't even feel it. It's nothing now. My goal is to work up to doing half marathons. Anyway, I recently started reflecting on what freedom really means to me. Freedom is not merely being able to give your stupid desk job the finger, or having the ability to spend your time as you wish thanks to material wealth accumulation.

Freedom is thinking about what you'd really like to achieve in life, and then going for it without fear, regret or what anyone else thinks. Freedom isn't having the option to eat cheeseburgers and doritos all the time, even though it technically is. The problem with doing so is that it separates you from the best version of yourself, and the best version of yourself is the freest form of yourself. Think about it:

The best version of yourself is the one YOU want to become. Want to be strong, athletic and have a nice body? Figure out what you need to do to get there. Take advice from guys who have what you want, replicate what they're doing, and eventually refine it such that it works better for you. This can only be done through self-discipline. Self-discipline = freedom, as Jocko Willink puts it.

FIRE is ultimately a mindset. Besides, as Charlie Munger once said: ""life is more than being shrewd at passive wealth accumulation"". Don't get me wrong, keep saving, folks. Just make sure you focus on maximizing your freedom in other areas of life as well. Imagine how freeing it is to be able to run long distances and not have to worry. You can just do it. It takes you places. You see things, scenery, people. You challenge yourself and it makes you feel good afterwards. THAT is true freedom.

Naturally, to begin I read and researched a lot, there was a lot to learn. I made some meaningful strides, and now have everything set in place, all I need to do is continue to save and invest and I’ll FIRE in 10 or so years. But I have continued to read, to research, to plan, to analyse, to overthink. This is not necessarily a bad thing but now I feel FIRE may be becoming too much of a focus - I’m too fixated on achieving FIRE above all else - and I think that will make me less happy.

Don’t get me wrong, I feel very lucky to have found the FIRE movement and to be able to confidently say I’ll be financially independent one day. What a gift that is in a world where most people constantly stress about money and are unsure if they will be able to retire.

My issue is feeling consumed by FIRE. Recently I found myself entertaining and working towards pursuing a career that will make me more money but would make me miserable (law). I started thinking yes I won’t like the work, it’ll be a tough corporate grind, but I’ll make more money and could FIRE faster so it’s worth it. I started putting FIRE as my number one objective and everything else, including happiness was secondary. This, in my opinion is the wrong way to think. 

I don’t want FIRE to be all about the destination, I want to enjoy the journey. I don’t want to work everyday until I’m 40 just to leave the workforce and say now I can start living. I want to go on long adventurous holidays, enjoy the work that I do, volunteer, spend my weekends with friends, focus on hobbies that make me happy - even though these things will slow down my path to FIRE. I don’t mind if I achieve FIRE 5 years later than I could have if I’ve enjoyed the journey twice as much along the way. Just something to think about. 

TLDR; achieving FIRE asap may be harmful to your long term happiness. You should enjoy the journey and not just the destination. Maybe consider doing some more fun stuff along the way 😊","self","https://redd.it/komsej"

&#x200B;

**Background**

When I first became interested in FIRE around 2010, I imagined that 2000 would go down as the worst time ever to retire. So, I decided to start tracking their portfolio performance. Since I was invested entirely in stocks, I looked at how they would do if they were 100% in stocks. These days I have FIRE'd, and my portfolio looks very different. But, I keep updating this analysis each year for fun!

Whenever I post this people ask about other asset allocations. That's more work than I feel like doing. But, I've added a line for someone 100% invested in 10-year treasuries at a 4% withdrawal rate. Comparing that with the stock performance can give you some idea of how a blended portfolio will do.

&#x200B;

**Results**

If you retired in 2000 with 100% S&P500 and stuck to a fixed 4% SWR, you were scared out of your mind only 9 years later with 23% of your portfolio remaining. But if you were super irrational and stayed the course, the next decade+ of returns were so good that you still have exactly 23% of your portfolio remaining as of 3 days ago! Still, you would need historically good returns over the next decade to not run out of money before a 30 year retirement horizon is up. And given the historically high CAPE ratios and low interest rates, I'm not optimistic about stock returns in the intermediate term.

If you were looking for a longer retirement window than 30 years, or if you wanted to preserve a significant portion of your portfolio value, it looks like the year-2000 retiree (who is 100% stocks) would have needed a much lower WR of 2.5-3%. But there are 2 pieces of good new. First, incorporating just a bit of bonds into your portfolio would have greatly offset the poor performance of stocks, leaving you pretty comfortable with a 3.5-4% SWR. Secondly, retiring just a few years before or after the worst retirement year in generations would mean you've actually seen your portfolio grow! Though, people do disproportionately [retire at the worst possible times](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/12/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-22-endogenous-retirement-timing/):(

ERN's data that I used:  [https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/08/29/google-sheet-updates-swr-series-part-28/](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2018/08/29/google-sheet-updates-swr-series-part-28/)  . You can use this to look at different asset allocations and to adjust  other assumptions. If you don't want to work with the raw data  directly, he has some tools in the spreadsheet that will do the analysis  for you when you adjust assumptions.

Here is the extra sheet I added to ERN's workbook, in case you want to play around with it: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JcSRDrGv9YxQmR8E8dAmLELRgtqiCFtw8lcdSRUyAVc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JcSRDrGv9YxQmR8E8dAmLELRgtqiCFtw8lcdSRUyAVc/edit?usp=sharing)

* These charts account for inflation (using CPI) and distributions (like stock dividends)
* Anyone nearing their FIRE goals should read [ERN's SWR series](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/). I learned a lot from it. And while I don't necessarily agree with all of his conclusions or assumptions, it's the best SWR analysis out there and better than anything I'd be able to put together.

**TL;DR**: grew up in poverty (financially only, plenty of love and plenty to be happy for), worked hard, valued education, and now I'm getting by. Components of my dashboard are **-linked-** within the post. Enjoy and critique!

**Background**

I'm 27, male, single, grew up in poverty in the rural Midwest. I'm first generation college along with my 2 siblings, state school educated, and tend to think I live below my means. I've been introduced as ""the cheapest a-hole you'll ever meet."" While I am frugal, I always pay more than my fair share, feed guests and provide alcohol, volunteer my time, and tip generously when services are provided (haircuts, meals out, ice cream).

I won't apologize for any privilege. My parents are hard working, loving people who dedicate their lives to our family. There was no family college or direct financial assistance. One of my earliest memories was asking my father if we were rich. His response, ""we are rich in love."" Growing up, we were 5 people living the American Dream, as far as I'm concerned.

I'm employed as an System Admin within the Federal Government. I'm IT by trade only; I majored in a physical science (BS & MS), and gravitated toward statistics and computer science within my field. My earnings/location by year:

* 2015-2016, WI, $15,000 (graduate school)
* 2017, DC, $45,000
* 2018, DC, $56,000
* 2019, DC, $69,000
* 2020, DC -> IN, $86,000
* 2021, IN, $93,000

I've been tracking money in and money out since starting grad school in Sept 2015. I'm talking every receipt, categorized (split & figure tax/item if, say, making a Walmart run purchasing variety of goods) and entered into excel. My approach will certainly seem excessive to some, but it takes me < 1 min to enter the data usually, and I find it fun and worthwhile. Different strokes for different folks.  I've collectively spent MANY untracked hours tracking my economy and developing this tool. It's an ever-changing tool that was originally based off of this [rudimentary budget](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/personal-budget-spreadsheet.html), and grew in inspiration of many of the financial tools I've come across in this sub.  I have linked to graph inspirations for those looking to replicate.

**-**[**Assets**](https://imgur.com/5Rb535S)**-**

My spreadsheet is driven by this Data-Assets timeline. In this snapshot, the timeline spans my period of record, Sept 2015 - Dec 2020. The blocks on the left are fairly self-explanatory. ""Returns"" are shown over the course of the timeline and for the last month (Dec 2020 in this case). ""Balance"" is the Asset balance for the last month of the timeline, and the Net/In/Out is the money in/out during that month. I count investments as money out, so the 'net' is money that didn't have a destination (didn't pay bills/groceries/get invested/etc). ""Savings Rate' donuts are for the last month of the timeline (dark green, 77% for Dec) and the year of the month (light green, 27% for 2020). This savings rate is: ((Take home pay - non savings spending) / take home pay). ""Financial Independence"" was an effort to track FI, though there is a lot of variability. ""Inflation Rate"" is non-savings/non-tax spending compared to the year before. This helps keep my lifestyle inflation in check. I moved cross-country and purchased a vehicle in cash in 2020, which contributed to the 2020 personal inflation.

Here is what the graph on the right represents:

* Purple: Health Savings Account. The dark purple is the amount of HSA invested; the light purple is held by the bank, earning 0.02%. The purple line is total $ in HSA
* Green: liquid assets. The bars represent Savings/Checking/Money Market, CDs, and Series EE Bonds, which were gifts from grandparents in the 90s/00s. The green line is total $ in fairly-easy-to-liquefy vehicles. I am risk averse and hold too much here, though home ownership is hopefully < 5 years away.
* Blue: Investments. The dark blue is retirement (Roth IRA and Thrift Savings Plan-a 401k). The light blue is my taxable brokerage. The blue line is total $ invested
* Black: total assets. I do not include vehicles or belongings in this. I rent, so no equity either.

The IRA/TSP/HSA donuts are used to see where I am in terms of contributions vs limits. Don't worry, the surplus $233 in IRA and $250 in HSA are 2020 contributions to the 2019 IRA/HSA.

​""Past 12 months"" are sparkline columns representing the relative proportion of the category over the past 12 months (right-most column is darker and is the last month of the timeline, Dec 2020 here). The categories are: taxes, housing, savings, transportation, food, utilities, medical, personal (clothing/toiletries/etc), alcohol, and entertainment. The actual vs expected graph (based on [this](https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/5838-excel-actual-vs-budget-chart.html)) shows what percent I spent on a category relative to my Net (after tax) Income (except I use Gross for savings and taxes). This doesn't add to 100 since I use a different basis for comparing 2 categories. This Savings rate calculation is *dedicated*\-savings only, which differs from the one in the 'Assets' section. I need to revisit, pick one way to calculate, and run with that.

A note on transportation. Prior to tracking, I owned a 1990 98 Oldsmobile regency and then a 1986 Ford Ranger. These vehicles cost $500 and $550 cash, and I paid that and insurance. And they broke down a lot and I spent a lot on repairs (though my dad and I did many of them at home). I lived car-free from 2015-mid2020. I bought a used Japanese car in Sept 2020 in cash when I moved to Indiana. I hope to keep it for many years.

The graph on the right is one of my favorites. I use GETPIVOTDATA to populate the table and create a heat-map of the selected category/sub-category. I can select as many subcategories to compare as I want. The graph is annual cumulative expenses based off the dynamic table. The gray lines are previous years, the bold black line is the average of the previous years, and the red line is the current year. The text (2020: $XXX, Average: $XXX) shows the current month vs average spending to date. This graph has really opened my eyes to the evolution of my spending habits. As a proud Wisconsinite, I've selected my alcohol-related expenses to compare in this image. ""Alcohol"" is liquor store purchases, and ""bars"" is money spent at bars.  In 2016, I was studying a lot and mostly pre-gaming and riding the buzz. Also, it was cheap to get drunk in Wisconsin (25 cent beer nights).  I spent a lot of time in DC bars being a reckless 20-something. I only drink socially, so consumption is down in 2020 thanks to COVID.

**-**[**Loans**](https://imgur.com/H3Sih7t)**-**

The home and vehicle loans are placeholders for whenever I might get those types of loans. My student loans were subsidized. I qualified for academic, community, and need-based scholarships and grants. They paid for my tuition and fees in full, and then some. I was a work-study student, which gave me an edge when applying for on-campus jobs. I averaged 25 hours of work per week, and volunteers 5 hours a week. I was enrolled full-time with 16-18 credit hours per semester. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA undergrad, and 3.9 GPA grad from a great Big 10 school. I worked my ass off and wasn't truly burdened by student loans, knowing I could pay off the loans I took at any time. The money I did borrow went toward living expenses and into the bank, since it was interest-free while enrolled. The amortization graphs are based on [this](https://spreadsheetpage.com/loan/amortization/).

If we assume that, whenever we retire, the only thing that matters is how we feel in the present, we can make a stronger case for making that moment as comfortable as possible.  I would definitely rather fly first class and have six vacations a year, as opposed to coach / two.  I would rather eat extravagantly than not.

Giving your money one more chance to rise by 50%, say another 4-5 years, would likely drastically change your comfort level for all your future “present”s.

It’s a similar concept as going through all the work to graduate college.  I have little memory these days of the pain of sleepless nights writing papers, but I’m sure glad, now, I put in the time to do it.  I don’t remember the struggle, but my present self reaps the gains every day. 

I feel this is different than the standard reasoning behind OMY, which is generally tied to wanting a bit of a cushion or concerns about current market conditions (ie, sequence of returns risk).

We can never predict how long we have on this earth, so I fully recognize the above can jeopardize some of that precious time.  But I do feel strongly that the past is always just a memory, and my present self is almost always happy with prior sacrifices I’ve made.

I am really struggling with how much longer to put in at work, so would love to hear some thoughts on this.","self","https://redd.it/kppkkq"

We built a retirement portfolio in rental property. The cash flow basically covers living expenses and inflation adjusts. In 15ish years cash flow will boom again when mortgages start to go away. 

I work a government job and have a pension coming at 55. I also have ss coming. She has ss coming and a growing 401k from corporate life. 
She left her corporate job 2 years ago and is a realtor now. It was supposed to be pre-tirement  but even working part time she is making 3x our annual expenses. The taxes are brutal.  We set up a sepp and she is pretty close to maxing that out annually. 
Add into this the fact that I flip houses occasionally and those hit as ordinary income. 

So if I leave my w-2 and business continues to be good do people typically continue to ‘save for retirement’ when retired?  Is there a point when income is already on track to be way more than enough by classic retirement age?

I suppose the obvious answer is work less.  But the money is pretty easy, frankly. We had been growing the At this point we just pay the taxes and accelerate pay down on properties so we have more money now rather than a huge boom later?  What is efficient?","self","https://redd.it/kpy48w"

I see a potential problem with this: in a typical FIRE portfolio the stock portion is large, and even larger now that bonds do not provide any return. Hence, in case of market swings, the total value of the retirement portfolio could get a negative drop (e.g. last March with the Covid crash).

QUESTION: in a retirement phase, shall the FIRE portfolio move to a more conservative mix and how to do so?

As alternative, what about migrating the growth portfolio used to reach the retirement new worth to a retirement portfolio based on distributing ETF? 

Just to give some examples on these latter products that I found (the dividend value is just an indication, not in real time with markets):

\- GLDV >> dividend \~4%

\- IAPD >> divident \~4%

\-STHE >> divident \~5%

\- EMLOC >> dividend \~5%

The above distributing ETF should provide a more stable conservation of the retirement capital, compared to a growth portfolio too pushed towards the stocks market in order to get.

I might be wrong, hence happy to discuss here - especially with people already in the RE phase.","self","https://redd.it/kq49q0"

I keep thinking one day I'll get out of the 9-5 world but have a hard time figuring out how and when to do it.   I always say ""just another year or so, the money is too good to turn down"" but I'll be 40 in March (not old I know).   While 40 isn't old, I don't want to keep running on autopilot until 50, or 60, and miss my opportunity to work less while young enough to enjoy it. 

Anyone else dealt with this scenario before?   What did you do? 

FYI I don't have enough 401k to retire and live on it yet, but calculations show I probably have enough to leave it be and then would have enough by the time I'm 65.   This the question about coast fire. 

Thanks.

Edit - thanks for all the replies.  What I'm thinking is maybe go for ""just another year or two"" full time if I can swing it, pad the accounts a bit more, which I probably can do since I'm not miserable and I'm in (seemingly) quite good health, and then at that point try to negotiate down to 3 or 4 days a week at the current place of employment and run that way for a while and see how it feels.  

That way I can keep doing something I know well and still be making enough money to tuck away a few dollars every month yet not live like a college student.   If I were to get say 60% of my paycheck now, I'd be fine since we are in a lcol area and don't have a mortgage or really any other payments besides utilities.   

My wife has great Healthcare (as do I) so we'd probably jump onto her plan if I went part time.  But at some point health care will be the kicker.  If she wants to go down to part time we will somehow need $1000/mo or more for health insurance.  Maybe we will have a public option by then.  I hope.  If not I guess one of us works full time until we are 67.  Fun.","self","https://redd.it/kqz7ho"

I am going to condense some of the important points about LTCI from that thread into this one.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqwm36/the\_real\_costs\_of\_aging\_and\_impact\_on\_adult/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kqwm36/the_real_costs_of_aging_and_impact_on_adult/)

LONG TERM CARE AND GENERATIONAL POVERY

I had not realized how the cost of long term care for parents can wreck someone's plan to use FIRE to escape the cycle of generational poverty.  If your parents were low income or did not save for their own retirement, and you are trying to break that cycle of poverty by pursuing FIRE, your plans may be jeopardized because you need to use your nest egg to pay for your parents' care.  Similarly, if you need to pay for your own longterm care out of your own nest egg, you won't have as much money to pass down to your own children.

MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

In the US, people over ~~62~~ 65 are eligible for Medicare, which helps with medical bills, but people are not eligible for Medicaid, which helps with long term care, until they have used up all their resources, including their equity in their home, and are effectively destitute.  Even then, the long term care provided by Medicaid is in short supply, is determined by the laws of individual states, and anecdotally is much worse than private care.  Lastly, any assets given to children with in the previous five (soon to be seven) years of applying for medicaid still count in the calculation, and will likely prevent parents from being eligible.

So, is LTCI the solution?  Should LTCI be part of our FIRE plans?

PRICE OF LONG TERM CARE

Here are national averages according to genworth.com.

     In-home care 5000/month
     Assisted Living 4500/month
     Nursing Home 8000/month

Care cost is location dependent.  You can find averages for your state here [https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html](https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html)

COST OF LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE

Long term care insurance usually has a benefit cap of about 160K, with a defined daily or monthly benefit (for example, $180 or $5000 respectively).  That means that ""Long term care"" only last around three years before the benefit is exhausted.

Insurance cost is location and age dependent, but here is a guide

     Average annual premium
    
     AGE 55
     Single Male	$1,876
     Single Female	$3,141
    
     AGE 65
     Single Male	$3,081
     Single Female	$5,085

From [https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-care-insurance-cost-4126749](https://www.thebalance.com/long-term-care-insurance-cost-4126749).  Note that female cost is higher because they live longer and are therefore may be more likely to need long term care.

SO IS LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE A GOOD IDEA FOR YOUR FIRE PLANS?

You really only need insurance for things you can't pay for yourself.  So, is LTCI worthwhile?

Let's look at a very simplistic example.  Assume I start my policy at age 55, and pay until age 70, then fall ill and die after three years of care.

I would have paid about 34K over 15 years (1876 x 10 years + 3081 x 5) for the insurance.  So I (or my estate) would come out 144k ahead (minus the opportunity cost of not having that money invested).

I have three kids that stand to inherit my estate, so part of my FIRE plan is capital preservation for them, so LTCI seems like a good bet for me.

What about you?

Too many people in this sub use % of Income, yet that isn't useful when for some people with very high salaries decreasing their spending means cutting back on only the most superfluous luxuries (fancy cars, boats, McMansions, etc.) while for others with more modest salaries it means cutting back on more typical luxuries such as eating out, vacations, spacious housing, etc. 

I think the living wage calculation is particularly good as it breaks down basic spending across all of the most significant spending categories, as well as taking into consideration the cost of living in any particular metro area/county, the number of dependents, and the number of income earning adults in the household. 

The fundamental idea behind living wage is that it is the amount of money necessary for someone to live a minimally comfortable life. Now I'm not saying that everyone should be aiming to be at or below this number, the documentation of the calculator even states that the values it provides are simply a ""step-up"" from poverty, but I think that these values would provide a good relative target, for example within 150%, to help people aim towards with their spending.","self","https://redd.it/ks7o8k"

I just wanted to thank many of you guys for the tips over the years and to give a bit of inspiration and tips to those who earn much less than the normal posters here. 

To give some perspective i'm 31 and 6 years into my FI journey (2 years into FIRE) I got started at 25 (2015) I was making about $300 per week in construction and my wife was out of work. One day I discovered the book The Richest Man in Babylon and was off to the races. Before that I was always a decent saver but had very little income, that book changed my outlook and my life. I started saving 1/10th of gross income and throwing into individual high quality stocks.

We were fortunate to live in a Very LCOL area but had about $5k in credit card debt and being in a small town without many job prospects and only a high school diploma not much hope of anything better but I still saved my $30 per week. 

I also started to follow the advice in the book and work on educating myself, I have always enjoyed technology and decided that would be my road out of the heat and cold of construction work. After looking through educational opportunities I decided to go for an IT degree with WGU since I figured I could accelerate and finish the degree earlier than expected. I did tons of research and was super excited when I sent in my Application to WGU. Unfortunately though I was declined...... From WGU... I felt dejected and stupid. A few days later I was told that my rejection was due to having 0 transferable credits and that If I went to a Community College and earned some I would probably be admitted. Sounds easy enough but I lived in a small town no where near a CC so i gave up on that and kept saving.   

About 7 months after being Rejected a new WGU admissions counselor called me and asked about my plans. He informed me that in place of college credits I could take 1 of the IT certifications (A+, Net+, Sec+)  and get enrolled if I passed one. I went on Amazon that day and spent 2 weeks worth of savings ($60) on a book to take the Network+ as I was very interested in understanding Networking and thought I could work on learning it as a new skill.

I studied and studied day and night (8hrs per day after work) for 4 months, paid the $300 test fee and scheduled the test. Never felt as much pressure on a test before since I knew I couldn't afford a retake. That test was the most difficult test I had ever taken in my entire life. I was so nervous to click the submit button at the end of it that I was sweating. But I passed! A few weeks later I was enrolled in WGU! And a few weeks after that since I had a Net+ cert I got a JOB! in IT! the pay was $13 per hour and a 45 min drive but I knew that was my shot and made it count. I was 26 when all of this happened (1 year into my FI journey). 

Fast forward - I advanced in the IT dept at that first company always volunteering to figure out and fix the hardest issues and seeking challenges while continuing the WGU course material. After a few years I had enough experience working with Data Systems that I moved a few hours away to a Larger Medium COL city and took a contract job making $90,000 per year. From that job I moved up the ladder and began saving more and more especially after discovering this sub-reddit.

 My wife and I were so impoverished in the beginning that we got used to that level of income and although we spend about $40k per year now including rent ($2300 per month), Insurance, utilities and car payments (We bought hail damaged cars 10K off brand new) as well as taking 2 large vacations per year internationally. We don't buy luxury items and still bargain hunt. On top of that my salary has increased to $140k and by living in a larger city my wife was able to get a job making around $30k. We now save 50+% of our income and work from home.  

Last year at 30 (5 years removed from poverty) I earned that Bachelors from WGU in IT. It took a lot longer than I hoped but that was due to my employment situation. I also hit the $100K Net worth mark that would have seemed like Mt. Everest not that long ago.  

I mainly wanted to post this for the ones who are starting off like I did 6 years ago. In small towns, without education or skills it can be a lot harder to find opportunities and its very easy to give up but I'm living proof that escape is possible and all of these 100K+ jobs that seem like dreams are actually very possible with a few years of hard work and determination. I really hope that you guys just keep working towards your goals, Don't let anyone or anything discourage you or disrupt your plans even if it hurts just keep going after it.","self","https://redd.it/kurz7v"

I was on active duty for a while and spent a short amount of time in a reserve component and it seems like a great fit for fire so I'd be curious to get other people's takes. Here are my initial thoughts:

* If I join again soon, I'll probably be an O4 (i.e. mid level officer) by my barista fire time period, so I'd maybe make around $15k - $25k / year depending on how much drill there is beyond the standard  2 days/month, 2 weeks/year (I always had to do more when I was in, which was a pain with a full time career, but 3 or 4 day weekends once a month doesn't sound as bad when you're not juggling a professional job).
* Cheap health insurance: \~$50/m for single, \~$200/m for family.
* I don't know how competitive these are but there are full-time positions in the reserves that you can take. In a FIRE emergency situation (either market crash or large unexpected expense), there's a path to a $100K+ job. I truly am not sure how difficult it is to get these full-time positions, but I imagine it's more likely than trying to go back to most professional jobs after 10 or 15 years out of the industry (I know in my field I would never get an interview with a gap that large; plus, you can take these positions for a year rather than trying to get a 100k+ job in the private sector that you want to quit after your investments recover).
* Pension: depending on far up the ranks you go and how long you stay in, it's probably $20k - $30k / yr plus cheap health insurance starting at 60.
* Some structure/progress in life: I know some folks want nothing to do with work--which I totally get--but I think it'd be nice to still have an organization that you can progress through but that doesn't take 60 hours/week of your life.
* There are probably some cool assignments that come up over time, especially as you get to a higher rank.
* Serve my country (This is a big positive for me, although I'm sure it's less meaningful to others). 

Obviously, possibility of deployment is a large con, and if someone is tired of hierarchy,  then the military is the last place you'd want to be.

I burnt out of the reserves while trying to balance a professional job but it sounds like a good barista fire job. What does everyone here think?

Also, one more thing since this came up (and dominated) all the prior threads on this top: joining the military for this is a less attractive option. You need 1 year+ of full time training (with certain exceptions) that will be a decidedly un-fire-like experience so this is geared more towards people who are already in or were in.","self","https://redd.it/kvhtz4"

Extreme saving to build up capital equaling 25x your expenses is one way to achieve FIRE. 
Retirement, in the traditional sense of retiring to a life of no particular work responsibilities is one type of retirement. 
BaristaFIREing to a quiet life of easy work is another option. 

All of these things have names. But all of these things are merely arbitrary points on a spectrum of infinite possibilities. Life isn't a forking path, with traditional FIRE going one way, with baristaFIRE pointing in the other direction, and no middle ground between them. You're ""allowed"" to retire to a life based on the 6% rule, with baristafire as a backup. You're allowed to become financially independent and never quit your job if you don't feel like it. You're allowed to retire at 32 fully FI, get bored, start a pottery studio, live off the income from the pottery studio for a while, get bored, close it down, then get a job with the county government cutting down trees. Life is too short to limit your choices to the default options on a forum. 

I think everyone here is aware of this, on some level. But, really  often on this sub, I see people falling into the easy ruts, like treating the 4% rule as an actual rule. Or, they let the easily defined concepts, like coastFIRE, define their goals, when it's pretty clear based on reading their writing that their real goal should be in the Grey Area Of FIRE That Has No Name Yet. Grey Area Fire That Has No Name Yet is perfectly fine.  

Don't let mental frameworks define your path -- let your honest assessment of the life you want to live define your path, and let the rough concepts and frameworks serve their purpose: giving people a starting point for conversations.","self","https://redd.it/kvwpam"

Quote from him:  “The thing is, when I got out of college, I had $9,800, but by the end of 1955, I was up to $127,000. I thought, I’ll go back to Omaha, take some college classes, and read a lot—I was going to retire! I figured we could live on $12,000 a year, and off my $127,000 asset base, I could easily make that. I told my wife, “Compound interest guarantees I’m going to get rich.” 

In ""retirement"", some people asked him what to do with their money, and he ended up starting a partnership to help manage money... the rest is history!

Just a fun thing I thought I'd share in this forum \^\^

For example, if you have $300k and are aiming for a cool $1m, you could save $25k per year and reach your goal in about 10.5 years thanks to compound interest.  Alternatively, you could save $50k per year and reach your goal in about 7.5 years.

In essence, having double the savings rate only shaves about 3 years off your timeline.  Of course, that's still a substantial amount of time but I start to ask those classic questions about the tradeoff.  The $25k per year difference is pretty substantial.  That's multiple awesome vacations per year for a decade.  That's housing upgrades.  That's college tuition.  All for just a few years longer.

I realize none of these ideas are new, and that all of this is a tradeoff.  I realize that ""One More Year"" syndrome and CoastFI probably have their roots in this line of thinking, but man—when faced with actual numbers, it seems like a no-brainer to ease up on your savings rate after hitting a certain critical mass.

After a strenuous career working your way towards financial independence, do any of you have or plan to have a *fun, no stress* job after you achieve FI, to remain productive in a familiar sense or socialize with people? 

During high school, I worked at a movie theater along with 2 (regularly retired) older gentlemen who lived comfortably, but worked at the movie theater a few days a week to talk to people, see free movies, and generally keep themselves entertained and sane.

Are any of you planning on doing the same?

**Edit:** A day later, it's been great to read over you guys' aspirations. Wherever you are in the FIRE process best of luck: enjoy working at a pizza parlor, teaching little league, or reading a good book in your hammock with a cold mimosa.","self","https://redd.it/kx1b43"

You’re complaining that your neighborhood bar got popular and the vibe isn’t the same anymore. Time doesn’t move backwards.

Regardless, the vast majority of upvoted comments in the thread were in support of the moderation.

We will not be changing our moderation practices based on a single post. It will go into our consideration in our regular internal review of moderation practices.

In the future, please use modmail rather than messaging individual moderators. Only one moderator sees this now unless I manually copy it to modmail. This is not the way.","self","https://redd.it/kxc6xy"

FIRE was not a thing when I started working/saving. I am trying to determine what I want to do as I contemplate pulling the trigger.","None",0.96,242,0,0,86,0,"I am 57 and have a net worth of approx 1.3M.  800K in self-directed IRA.  200K in non-sheltered investments, about 50K in my new company 401k, 130K in cash (due to a sale of a home).  Home free and clear about 130K in value.

I have been a single income provider working in IT for the last several decades.  The majority of my funds are the result of maxing out my 401K since I entered the workforce.  In that time I have owned several homes.  moved several times and paid cash for my kids (2) college, cars, weddings etc.  


I recently took a job managing development, QA and data services for a company based out of a small town in midwest.  Middle of no-where.

My wife and I absolutely love the small town vibe.   we have always lived in larger metro-plex suburbia.

I have always assumed that I would just keep working until my mid-60s and then; not sure (retire, die, something).  I have never really planned out what happens after.

Living in a small town I have really grown to appreciate the outdoor activities.  Hiking, fishing, (Hunting again after 25+ years).  


I am suddenly very much thinking about just.....   NOT WORKING anymore.    


With really liking small town vibe; owning a house free and clear.  No big expenses (kids/education/etc).  I am just realizing that I can probably do so tomorrow if I wished.  


I am new to this sub-reddit and after reading through a lot of this, I realize that i really could have focused on this as a family goal and probably retired 10 years ago if we had prioritized additional investments.  Rather than just investing through my employer plans.

This is a lot of rambling, please forgive me.  But I want you guys to know that this is VERY doable.  I got here and I wasn't even really focused on this goal.  I just laid out a mostly painless path through 401K investing.

From a retirement perspective my wife and I have gotten very excited about potential travel to equivalent locals globally.  Meaning, look for small towns in Costa Rico, Panama, Portugal, Montenegro, etc and stay for 3 months at a time.  get to know the people and the culture.  I have had the good fortune to travel quite a bit for work and vacations.  But I have NEVER had a break longer than 10 days since 03/21/88 (first day on a ""real"" job)

NOTE:
I am overwhelmed by the amount of support and very helpful and interesting feedback I have received.  My intent was just to encourage others in their progress.  I have gained much more that I gave through this exchange.

From 10/hr in my mid-twenties to coast fire in early 30s","None",0.93,282,0,3,107,0,"I’ve been meaning to write this post for a while. This sub has really helped me with my relationship to money and to understand the cost/benefit of time vs money. This sub is especially helpful to people like me that come from a different country and no one in their family has retirement accounts or knows how to invest. 

I have been coast fired since late last year when I left my job. I’ll give you a quick summary of my background and then I’ll just talk about coast fire and my finances. 

Summary: Family came to U.S with no money, zero English and was undocumented. Got my citizenship in my early 20s. First and only one in extended family to graduate from college at 25. Once I started making real money, I found this sub and learned how to invest and think about money. I went from making $10/hour in my early 20s to $100k by my 30s. Long hours led to burn out and quit once I was coast fire. Took some time off and now working as freelancer. 

Life in coast fire: I’m working from home so I can run errands during the week. I don’t have an alarm clock, just wake up on my own. I have time to exercise and also take a 40 minute walk on most days. I can take a long lunch if I want to. Once or twice a week I’ll go to the park or a trail nearby.  One thing I hated about working is going to work early and leaving by the time it was dark. I really appreciate the opportunity to spend some time outside basking in the sun during the week. I have more time to meditate and I’ve read a lot more books during this time. 

I volunteer for some organizations and I’m part of some boards. I joined an organization to help me with public speaking & we meet weekly. Even though I haven’t been working full-time like before I’ve managed to keep busy.

I’ve tried different hobbies this past year thanks to the advice of this sub. I tried skiing, baking, drawing, Pilates, oil painting, journaling, a mindfulness course, biking, nail art, and basic coding. There were several hobbies I did not enjoy and won’t do again but I’ll keep up with a couple like journaling and riding my bike. 

Once Covid is under control, I want to spend summers or winters traveling for three months out of the year. And I want to try more social hobbies such as golf and tennis beginner classes, line-dancing, going to more concerts and music festivals, a photography class, book club and some leadership seminars. 

Finances: My net worth consists of my 401k that was rollover to Vanguard, Roth IRA accounts and some brokerage accounts. I don’t have a house and I don’t think I’ll buy one. 

According to mint this is my net worth over time. I don’t have data prior to 2018 because I wasn’t keeping track before.

2018 $100,000 
2019 $200,000 
2020 $250,000 

Budget 
Rent $6,000 
Groceries/ eating out $4,600 
Shopping $2,600 
Auto $1,700 
Travel $1,600 
Personal care $600 
Bills $2,700 
Business expenses $3,500 * this also includes cobra & disability insurance that I paid for the last 3 months of 2020. 

Salary Progression 
Before college $8 to $10/hour | After college $40k/year > $45k > $52k > $62k > $78k $85k > $90k > $100k 

The only debt I have is about $5k in student loans. This means that I only need around $20k to cover my expenses. But I’d like to make more to have more money to travel in style, pay for some classes and just have more room in the budget.

I feel that now I have an idea of what I’d like to do if I do end up retiring early. And this also showed me that I can fill my time and have structure even when I’m not working.","self","https://redd.it/kytsns"

Checking in for my fourth annual post. I post these as a way to motivate people who don't make crazy incomes. When I started posting, we collectively grossed about 82k in total income with BAs. We've grown and now gross a little north of $107k  W2 income with MAs, as well as $15,300 gross annual rental income. This is in a LCOL city in the Midwest.

The tl;dr of previous posts is that we taught/worked abroad in China for three years, eliminating 55k of student debt and paving the way to pay for grad school in cash. Moved back to the US in 2017, where I work as a social service administrator and SO works as a teacher. Somewhere along the way we picked up real estate investing, but nothing too substantial compared to some people.

**INCOME/W-2 EMPLOYMENT SUMMARY**

\---Me (29 y/o) - Social Service Program Manager - $52,481 +7.5% match

I've been WFH since all of this began, which coupled with my parental leaves means I haven't been in the office for over a year. I’m still having issues with my supervisor, so much so that I nearly quit during one of the flare ups and took a lower pay paraeducator position to escape the relationship. Instead of going that route, I enrolled in a program that will get me certified in the US to teach. I should be certified in summer 2021, I’ve applied for some positions for next year and may choose to pivot away to teaching again at that point. It’s difficult to plan for this though, as my company has incredible benefits and we’re still growing our family. Golden handcuffs. Despite the challenges with my supervisor, I was told during my performance review that I’m a high achiever and continuing to exceed expectations. I tried leveraging that for a 10% pay bump, but HR policies and the COVID context ultimately put a stop to that. All staff in my company were given 2% raises, regardless of performance.

\---Spouse (28 y/o) - Teacher - $54,861

SO continues to love her job, though teaching in the COVID context while mother to a newborn has been emotionally and physically challenging. SO received an 8.53% pay bump from last year due to 1) continuing to plow through additional coursework to move up salary scale, 2) being nominated to join a specialized committee ($500), 3) the salary schedule being renegotiated upward for the fourth year in a row, and 4) being nominated to mentor a new teacher ($1000).

**FAMILY SUMMARY**

We’re both getting itchy feet to go abroad again. While I’m actively applying for positions in my company overseas, we’ve both essentially accepted that it will need to be through teaching. I had a dislike for teaching, but have come to accept that work is something I will likely never ‘enjoy’ and I will likely transition in and out of fields during my working career. Fortunately, the two fields I’ve done are relatively symbiotic and can be leveraged for career advancement. We hope to relocate abroad in the near future, ideally in fall 2022. Updates other than this? We received an unexpected 15k gift that went to brokerage accounts. I picked up guitar October 2019 and have really taken to it, adding significantly to my mental health and resilience during the pandemic. SO has taken up art, adding similar benefits. Kiddo is happy and healthy, and a huge joy to our family. I love being a dad, and the perspective gained from this experience (combined with having financial assets) makes my less than ideal supervisor situation so much more manageable. I just have to remember to take a step back and say, “Does what she’s mad about actually matter in the grand scheme of things?”.

**BUSINESS SUMMARY**

Property #1 - 20% down on $60,000 SFR, $800 base rent with $40 and later $60 pet rent

Last year I reported our realtor thinking we could sell for $75,000 after some slight renovation. We were on the fence with this, but after selling our primary residence at a profit, we were hungry for more while mitigating the risk of the neighborhood the property was in. On closer inspection, our realtor indicated 5k in renovation may catch 80k quickly. We went forward with it, things went overbudget 2.5k, and we ended up listing for 85k. The house sold in 7 hours for 90k. Basing ROI on our 12k downpayment, our overall ROI for this property was 67.47%, while learning a lot about business, landlording, and home repair. Overall, a definite win. We’ll see how this all shakes out with taxes this year, though it should be LTCG and I think we have enough deductions to shield from tax liability.

&#x200B;

Property #2 - 10% down on $270,000 Duplex, \*$2575 rent\*, estimated $2800 rent potential

This is our current primary residence. Class A neighborhood with class A tenants. We pay ourselves $1300 in rent to simulate renter performance. Our tenants started with us at $1200, but after adding a fence (we and the tenants have dogs), this was bumped to $1225 within the first month. We then did a full floor renovation in the fall, bumping rent to $1275. I’d like to find a way to bump rent to $1300, but we have really excellent tenants that take amazing care of the house. Shampooing carpets every 6 months, painting the entire unit (we covered paint costs), adding shelves to the garage, and even sodding the backyard. After the fall renovation, we signed them for a 2 year lease, locking in the great tenants and income for the remainder of the time we envision being in the US.

COVID has been crazy for real estate, with prices skyrocketing in our city. 3 months after purchasing this property, another sold down the street for 30k more than we purchased for. This was lower quality interior, poorly thought out floor plan, and only $1100 rent. Last month I was shopping duplexes and did some walkthroughs. I noticed much lower quality properties in similar zip codes going for 70k more than we purchased for. I asked our realtor to run the numbers and was told we could likely sell for $420-$450k. Which is CRAZY! I’m incredibly tempted to sell now, but I think the family needs some stability. We’ll likely revisit the topic next year when we would qualify for capital gains exclusion after 2 years of residence and be closer to our planned move abroad.

**NETWORTH SUMMARY**

&#x200B;

Business Total - $40,527.46 (Equity & Cash)

Equity - $31,178.29

Cash - $9,349.17

&#x200B;

Total 2020 contributions - $36,769.45

For 2021, I’m hoping to have more sustained high contributions. From my side of the income, 20%+7.5% match ($1110.19) will be going to retirement, while SO will have about $1375 monthly. I’ve also set up automatic investments of $35/week to go to each of our roths and our brokerage. An interesting observation I noticed with this is that upping our contributions significantly doesn’t have as large of an effect as I would have expected in my FIRE Calc.This is likely because of our already significant contributions, combined with how much has already been contributed already and how growth doesn’t have as much of a chance to take over. For example, we could step off the gas and just do our bare minimums (getting match and required pension) and we still FIRE at 52, as opposed to 42 currently. Whereas if we strain ourselves to what might be uncomfortable, we shift the FIRE date to 40 years old. This is all based on a 5.84% return, so pretty conservative.

Not sure what else to add, [but here are some parts of my spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/a/Xno3ms4) I like to look at when work has me down.

tl;dr - Still chugging along, still planning, still growing. Happy.","self","https://redd.it/kz9fc2"

Feeling like my obsession with FIRE and money has taken over my life.","None",0.93,1266,0,6,495,1,"TL;DR - My motivation to FIRE has taken over my life to the point where I'm having a hard time enjoying spending my money or the simple joys and journey of life because I see every decision as either helping or harming my ability to FIRE.

\-----------------------------------------------------------

I discovered FIRE about 2-3 years ago after a friend posted an article to a blog post from Millenial Revolution. Luckily enough, I had made some of the right decisions already (i.e. paid off my student loans, contributed to 401k up to match), but after I discovered FIRE and calculated that I could retire early in 7 years, I started to aggressively save, dumped every spare dollar into index funds, and lowered all my expenses.

I hit $500K in net worth last month and it was a satisfying number to look at, yet as I was scrolling through old photos of myself from 5-7 years ago, I realized I wasn't necessarily happier for it. Over the past 2 years, I realized I've become more annoyed with work, and paralyzed or fearful of making any decisions that jeopardize my ability to FIRE. In the past, I would happily book an expensive, peak-season flight to an international country, buy a new camera just because I wanted it and I would be driven and motivated at work, exhibiting all the behaviors I needed to land that next promotion.

But since discovering FIRE, I haven't taken any international trips, haven't bought anything that's expensive yet could further my hobbies or interests (e.g. new camera for photography, roof rack for car), and outright stopped caring about work to the point where my attitude towards it has become bitter and resentful. I figure if I just coast at my job for the next few years, I'll hit my FIRE goal within 5-7 years. But it is actually out of character for me to care so little about my career and feel so apathetic. My coworkers are pretty surprised and baffled at my apathy towards work.

I'm seeing every single decision I make is either for or against achieving FIRE. Have a baby? But that might push out my FIRE date. Buy a house? It would be a dumb decision in NYC based on all the blog posts I've read. Hold a wedding? How many more years will I need to work? Buy a new laptop? But that's $XXXXX lost if I invested it in the market instead. Get a new job? Why bother, I just need to suck it up for 5 more years. Etc. Etc.

Now I'm wondering if I would've been happier if I didn't discover FIRE at all... If I was ignorant? I see some friends who have no idea what FIRE is happily enjoying their money and their life and I am jealous of them. I feel like it's become a mental restraint I've placed on myself. And these next 5 years feel like they're going to be pretty miserable until I can hit my FIRE #.

Any suggestions on how to break out of this mindset would be appreciated!","self","https://redd.it/kzma15"

Journey, thoughts, and numbers below.

Journey before destination.

#This is way longer than I intended; it also has all the info in it I enjoy hearing about other people’s FIRE journeys. . . sorry for the length.

###Background (Skip this if you want; I enjoy reading these, so I lay it out for others)

I had terrible money habits growing up: they continued until I was 26.  *Really* bad.  I grew up on foodstamps, and we never had *any* excess money; anything that came in went right back out on expenses.  I’d like to say they were necessities, but looking back. . . I think we could have done a lot better.  The scarcity mindset that living at the financial edge instills is real, and I continued to spend every dollar available to me (by work or by loan) until I stumbled across FIRE.  Constantly racked up credit card debt, and took every dollar that was ever available on student loans.

I regret taking the amount of student loans we did; we could have done less (though not anywhere near zero)  They say “That first 100K is hardest”, but it’s really that “That first 100K from *zero* is hardest” because if you hit a low point of -172,000, compound interest doesn’t really help you for that first 272K. . .

Income/expenses listed are at the end of that calendar year.

* *2011, age 24:*

Graduated in 2011 with a Civil Engineering Degree, wife was a student, working on a Masters in Public Health.  This was the absolute peak of the financial crisis for engineering.  I took a (not quite full time) temp job as a web developer making $20/hr, and we maxed out taking my wife’s student loans:

**Income: 31K me, 0K wife, 31K comb  ||  Exp: ~40K  ||  NW: -$163,000**

* *2012:*

Wife graduated grad school halfway through the year and got a fellowship for $24/hr.  My temp work finished halfway through the year, and I ‘worked’ full-time applying to engineering jobs.  Finally got one after a few hundred resumes, but wouldn’t start until just into the new year, 2013.  Which left that year at:

**Income: 12K me, 26K wife, 38K comb   ||  Expenses: ~40K  ||  NW: -$172,000**

* *2013, age 26: the tipping point year for FIRE*

Note that we *moved significanly backwards* the previous year in net worth due to student loan interest and spending. . .

Started a job as an engineer!  $52k per year ($25/hr).  Straight salary, with a terrible (in retrospect) company.  Worked a *ton* of hours, but only got paid the base salary.  I shudder to think what my hourly rate (working a lot of 70 hour weeks) actually was averaged over this year. . .  Still a financial step up!

**Discovered FIRE.**  I cannot stress enough how big of a change this made for my wife and me.  My wife was naturally a frugal person (I was *not*) but we both had otherwise terrible habits.  Once about my third real check rolled in I googled “Student Loan Repayment” and in the process of trying to find a more robust calculator (I was looking for, essentially, [unbury.us](http://unbury.us), though I didn’t know at that time it existed) and happened to stumble across Mr. Money Mustache in February.

I would like to pause for a minute to point out how terrible of a name this is:  I can credit this one website with legitimately changing my life in a very positive way, but if I ever try to explain what this life-altering blog was, it’s. . . mister money mustache.  Sigh.

I was consumed.  In less than a month I had read everything (and I mean *everything*) on MMM, MadFientist, and JL Collins; I devoured *Your Money or Your Life*, *Rich Dad, Poor Dad* and *The Richest Man in Babylon*.  My wife and I planned out our financial goals (Get student loan free, then try to retire in 15 years; will finish well ahead of this) and drastically reduced expenses.  Started aggressively paying down student loans by ‘minimum payment amount’ first to reduce our DTI ratio, hoping to qualify for a mortgage.

I became obsessed with the idea of having a miniature empire of rental units that would help me reach FI faster: small, clean, well-maintained places that I loved and the tenants loved.  Planned to ‘house hack’ by getting a duplex and living in half – the worse shape the better!  I’d always been handy, I was looking forward to sweat equity.  Started looking for a house in May.

Got married in July of this year; I suppose all previous references to ‘wife’ should read fiancé before this. . .

**Bought a duplex:** We were approved for a mortgage due to having some *long* repayment lengths on student loans which kept our DTI ratio on *just* the right side of acceptable, and bought an absolute shithole of a duplex with 3% down in November in a pretty nice neighborhood in Minneapolis.  This was $196K, which seemed *really* high from the lows of 2009; that sounds funny in retrospect now looking back, but everyone was worried it was the midst of a second bubble at the time.  Moved in to one half, and inherited some tenants in the other.  Started rapidly fixing it up with every spare hour I had, as I was still working about 60 hours a week on average.

It was a busy year.

**Income: 52K me, 44K wife, 96K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$140,000**

* *2014:*

Hey, the NW is moving the right direction!!  But now we reach “the boring middle” part of FIRE.  My wife got a full time job with benefits (as opposed to a fellowship) with a pay bump.  I got a 12% raise from my terrible company, mostly in response to threatening to leave due to working conditions.  Working conditions did not improve.  At the end of the year I switched companies (wont’ be reflected in this years salary) to the place I’m still with.  They are a hugely better company to work for, and they pay for *every* hour I work.  The pay was about the same per hour, but since I was working 60hr/week I essentially got a 50% raise.

We began to live on just my wife’s paycheck, and used 100% of mine to pay off student loans/invest.  This hasn’t changed to this day. . . except we now also invest some of hers.

**Income: 58K me, 56K wife, 114K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$97,000**

More of the same, paying off student loans in 2016, continuing the aggressive saving until 2020. . .

* *2016:* **Income: 86K me, 70K wife, 156K comb   ||  Expenses: ~50K  ||  NW: -$33,000**

* *2017:* **Income: 101K me, 72K wife, 173K comb   ||  Expenses: ~60K  ||  NW: $45,000**

* *2018:* **Income: 93K me, 74K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $110,000**

* *2019:* **Income: 92K me, 75K wife, 167K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $300,000**

* *2020:* **Income: 110K me, 76K wife, 186K comb   ||  Expenses: ~48K  ||  NW: $700K**

Note that NW has some weird jumps once we got past zero because the duplex went from essentially zero cash flow (lot of costs going in tended to burn all the rental income) to positive cash flow as we started to wrap the years of renovations, to a huge jump upon sale.

 
###2020:  Deciding to Simplify (Start again here, this is the point of the post!)

We had a kid.  

I had already been getting worn out of rental maintenance, especially as we had moved out of the duplex entirely and were renting both halves, now that it was nice.  Working a ton, and feeling like between a (more than) full time job, child, and rental, something had to give.  It was amazingly difficult to find a decent rental manager.

Our personal expenses had slowly shrunk down to be about $4,000/month, $1,500 of which was the mortgage on our new house.  In addition were the duplex costs, and the possibility that I had to have enough cash reserves to cover three furnaces, three water heaters, three stoves; also potential vacancies, other big ticket items (like a $14,000 roof job on the duplex, water damage from ice dams, etc) that were always potentially looming.

The rental income *did* cover these expenses: The duplex was working as a business.  But I was having basically $7,000 a month in expenses despite a fairly frugal lifestyle that had to be covered; **$84,000 a year that *had* to be earned and burned no matter what.**  My wife took a big chunk of time off for maternity, and I wanted to do significantly less, but this ‘burn rate’ was weighing on me.

Our three biggest expenses were the duplex, our house, and taxes.  Taxes are as low as they can be (all tax-advantaged accounts maxed out) and I’m happy to give back to the education and food programs that helped me, growing up.  But, I could sell the duplex, and roll all the profit into the new mortgage, and potentially go from needing to earn and burn $84,000 per year to $30,000. . .
 
###Rent out vs. Sell

I ran the numbers on if I kept the duplex, vs selling and investing it in the stock market.  I looked over the the next 6 years, which is about/past my FIRE date.  My estimated net worth difference would be around $80,000!  Nothing to sneeze at!  However, it also would be the difference between ~$1.3M and ~1.2M, both of which are over my FIRE number of $950K for 3.25% SWR.  If this had been the difference between $0 and $100K, that’d be huge.  That 1st 100K is the hardest.  The 13th 100K, however, is not.

I also had the added wrinkle that if we sold in 2020, it counts as a primary residence, and we don’t pay gains tax on the part we had lived in two of the last five years; this reduced the calculated 80k difference.

**Purposeful “Mistake” number 1: The duplex is gone.**

Was it worth an 8% reduction in net worth in 6 years to me to not have to deal with the rental property with a young child or two?  A thousand times yes.  I will have, I think, significantly less wealth in 30 years because I sold the rental duplex back in July.  But I will have *enough* either way, and I shall never get these years back.

I think buying, renovating, and renting that duplex was the best single financial action I ever took.  I’m happy I ground it out and did the completely hellish task of gutting a 110 year old building in the evenings around a 60hr/week job.  I also don’t think I’ll ever do it again. . .

### Pay off Mortgage vs Invest

What about, now that I’ve sold the duplex, putting it all in the market vs. paying off our home mortgage?  The numbers are pretty simple:  

5% real returns in the stock market (8% returns, 3% inflation, assumed).  Mortgage was, by happenstance, almost the same amount we got out in cash from the duplex, $153K.  We would then not have to pay the $1500/month that was going to principal and interest, and could invest that.  All number – as always – in 2021 dollars for simplicity.

* $153K invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $205k.
* $1,500/month invested for 6 years at 5% real gives you $125K.
* A difference of, again, $80,000.  At least I’m consistent. . .

This one was much harder; I really wanted to reduce my ‘burn rate’, but this basically means that selling the duplex **and** using that to immediately pay off my mortgage made us (statistically) $160,000 poorer in about 6 years, another $80k of gains gone.

However, despite me not believing (allegedly) in timing the market, the CAPE is currently quite high. . . and I’m getting awfully close to being able to FIRE anyways, 4-8 years, pending variables.  I also intend to transition my 100% equities to a [100/60/100 V-shaped Bond Glide]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/09/13/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-19-equity-glidepaths/) to maximize safety at the cost of potential gains.  I also believe that [it doesn’t make sense to carry a mortgage into early or regular retirement]( https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/10/11/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-21-mortgage-in-retirement/).  These aren’t just numbers in a spreadsheet, I actually have to be able to shift the funds to be able to do this, in a way that’s not crippling from a tax perspective.  It’s going to take years to shift to a bond allocation slowly; trying to pay the mortgage off at the same time could very well be impossible.

I don’t have a target FIRE date; I intend to work less and less as I slide into ER, and having the mortgage paid off means that my wife and I can do this whenever we want, without having to do 5 years of financial maneuvering in the background to ‘pull the trigger’.  

The flexibility is worth it.  **Purposeful “Mistake” number 2: The mortgage is gone.**.

We now live very comfortable – I would say luxurious – lives on about $2,500/month.  This will increase sporadically for large trips and childcare, but is our past and current expenses, and will be further in the future too.  I intend to build a fairly large cushion in passive income over this for unforeseen events, then charity, if those don’t materialize, but we don’t feel impoverished in any way at this spending level.

We are privileged enough, lucky enough, and determined enough to now be making about $45/hr each gross, $36/hour each takehome.  This means we need to work a combined 70 hours in a month to be able to cover our expenses; that’s 35 hours each, or  an average about 8 hours *a week* throughout the year.  We are primed to be able to slowly “BaristaFIRE” with reduced hours and benefits in our current jobs, which we both (mostly) enjoy.  

We will both be only when we want – which might be not at all – by age 40.  If you had asked me at 25 if this was possible, I would have laughed in your face.","self","https://redd.it/l0jlhc"

Can 6% inflation decimate your balanced portfolio?","None",0.62,37,0,0,103,0,"I recently FIRED at 45 with 3.5M, not including my personal residence (1M). My annual spending ranges from about 75 to 80K.  Therefore, my low SWR of 2.3% should last according to the 4 % rule and other popular studies, (e.g. a 3% SWR should never deplete). However higher inflation could still wreak havoc on your nest egg and increases the likelihood of portfolio failure. 

So I'll be using my own numbers to illustrate this example using FireCalc.

For Early Retirees, the typical advice is to maintain a high equity allocation in the portfolio to offset higher inflationary periods. I don't disagree, but this seems to work well for moderate inflation of 3 to 5% but really starts falling apart when inflation reaches 6% and beyond as we have seen in the past. 

&#x200B;

* At 5% inflation FIRECalc found that 3 cycles failed, for a success rate of 96.8% (100% equities)
* At 6% inflation  FIRECalc found that 20 cycles failed, for a success rate of 78.9% (100% equities)
* at 7% inflation FIRECalc found that 35 cycles failed, for a success rate of 63.2%(100% equities)
* at 8% inflation FIRECalc found that 54 cycles failed, for a success rate of 43.2%  (100% equities)

Furthermore, the negative effects are ""magnified"" if **bonds** are used in the portfolio. The success rates would be even lower. For example at 6% inflation with a 60/40 balanced portfolio, the success rate drops to **18.9%.** 6% seems high by today's standards but not impossible! Everyone is assuming inflation will stay low for years but no one really knows when rates will start rising and when they do, anyone holding a balanced portfolio will likely feel its negative effects.

Could someone **knowledgeable** in this matter offer some advice about how to handle high and consistent inflation during retirement? 

My initial thoughts about risk management:

* Reduce spending 
* Stay diversified globally, 
* Holding some Real Estate
* Maintain a high asset allocation to equities and learn to live with market volatility/crashes because inflation is as much of a risk.
* Go back to Work if required
* Win the lottery

Assumptions: 

Using  [https://www.firecalc.com/](https://www.firecalc.com/) to simulate possible scenario's I noticed that higher inflation could eventually decimate a well-diversified portfolio even if invested in 100% equities.

Plugging in numbers in Firecalc yields the following:

**\[Start Here Tab\]** 

* Spending: **$80,000**
* Portfolio: **$3,500,000**
* Years: **55**

**\[Other Income Tab\] -**  **Social Security** 

* Social Security: **19,000 in 2040**
* Social Security: **12,000 in 2040 (spouse)**
*  Pension Income: **0** 

**\[Not retired Tab\]**

*  What year will you retire: **2021**
*  How much will you add to your portfolio until then, per year: **0**

**\[Spending Models Tab\]**

* ""unclick"" CPI and use the following inflation assumption: **6% or more for inflation**
*  click - **Constant Spending Power**

**\[Your Portfolio Tab\]**

*  How much are you paying in investing fees: **0.4**
*  **Total market** \- change - Percentage of your portfolio that is in equities too: **100%**

It’s helped me achieve financial stability and growth while truly enjoying life (something that can be hard when aiming for a super high savings rate). 

Things I spend on without beating myself up: travel, tattoos, yoga, my partner, my cat, and renting a decent place for myself. These things bring me legitimate joy. 

Things I mercilessly cut spending on: clothes, restaurants/bars, furniture, cars, and new tech/devices. These things don’t really affect my happiness. 

You may have completely different priorities than 
me, and that’s great! My point is just to make it clear what you care about, and allow yourself to direct money that way. Even though I spend on things I love, my monthly spending has taken a nosedive by saving on things I don’t care about.

Much love to you all!

Edit: Wow thank you for the love and awards on my first-ever Reddit post. As many of you pointed out, the quote is from Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich. I also wanted to clarify that “extravagant” doesn’t necessarily mean “luxury.” When I say I spend extravagantly on things, I still do so responsibly. Example: I love travel but that doesn’t mean I book first class tickets and five star hotels. It means I travel cheaply so I can afford more trips throughout the year. It’s all about forming a positive and honest relationship with yourself 🖤","self","https://redd.it/l27w0g"

The plan and the match is extremely attractive, and while it is not a 401(k) it allows me to defer up to 75% of my income in a year, payable upon retirement over a 10 year period.

Much of the perspective I’ve read has contributions to these plans over and above 401(k) contributions. That is not my case beyond My wife maxing out her 401(k) and putting the maximum into an HSA. 

Is anyone else in a similar position to me, and how have you approached contributions to these plans and for them Into a FI RE strategy? This is a good problem to have, but a problem  nonetheless.

My parents (60+ M/F) both come from very poor families. They met after high school, worked and had kids, and 40+ years later, after hard work (my dad worked the graveyard shift for most of his career) combined with some luck (no major health issues, no discrimination preventing them from purchasing a home) and good decisions (living a modest lifestyle, staying in the same house for 30 years, etc.), they are about to retire. They will end up retiring about ""on time"" by traditional measures (65ish). Thinking of my own, relatively new journey to FIRE, I'm thankful that they are doing well. They didn't give me money or tell me about FI, but they modeled how to save, how to be happy with what they had, and how to take work seriously and do my best. And now they are giving me the gift of what I hope will be many more decades to make memories with them when they are not stressed out with work. After Covid, I have dreams of taking them to national parks in the U.S.. This motivates me to work hard for FIRE--not just so I can get there, but so I can enjoy time with those I love. Anyone else have experiences with family unknowingly motivating them to FIRE?","self","https://redd.it/l2qzyd"

# Quick Stats

Net worth: $1MM + 100K home equity + 20K car equity

Budget: 40K per year

Age: 27

# The career

tl;dr: Software 2016-2021, huge salary and got lucky with stock.

I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents for teaching me frugality, to my brother for teaching me how to be a high achiever, and to the internet for filling in the rest of the gaps. This journey really starts in 2007 when I started high school. My local state university had a full-ride scholarship, and I decided I was going get it.

In college, I picked a comp sci major because it was the most lucrative option that I was interested in. Leaving college, I had 40K in my pocket thanks to the scholarship, high paying internships, jobs for professors, living with family, and working jobs in high school. I built a strong resume, and practiced interviewing intensely, so I could basically pick whatever company I wanted to work for.

I picked a pre-IPO company over a FAANG, which shouldn't have been the right call, but I got very lucky. My interviews went so well that I started out at a Software Eng. II position, which basically means I got a promotion before even starting. My mentor/manager there was incredible, and I owe much of my career success to him. Over the next three years, I was promoted once as an engineer and then promoted to management. The company IPO-ed and the stock popped!

That's really the peak of my career. I burnt out after that, and moved into a non-management role within the company. This didn't really help, so I jumped to another company where I worked as a engineer for about half a year before going back into management. This too didn't really help, and I never got back onto my A-game. I truly love building software, but I am just so over working for large companies.

Between negotiating great salaries, getting big raises, and most importantly my companies' stocks doing incredibly well, I now have $1MM.

# About the Money...

tl;dr: 4% rule. 40K expenses, $1MM invested + 120K home/car equity.

## FIRE Number

My FIRE number was originally 750K, but as I got closer to it, I realized that is was too low. Healthcare costs rise as you get older, and I want to do more travelling than I initially budgeted. I blew past 750K and didn't immediately quit.

It gets easier (and I got lucky). The first 500K took me 4.5 years in the workforce. The second 500K took me six months.

## Budget

I spent 30K in 2020 and I could have lived leaner, but 30K was a comfortable balance of frugality and splurging. For 2021, I am budgeting 40K. This differs from my 2020 budget by adding $2,820 for health insurance, $1,800 to amortize vehicle purchases, and the rest is for transportation/travel/entertainment that wasn't possible during a pandemic.

## Investments

My investment breakdown is roughly:

* 46% VTI
* 40% company stocks (from where I worked)
* 9% VT 
* 5% 401(k) (fairly diverse ETFs, almost all equities)

The goal is 100% VTI, but I can't dot it yet for tax reasons.

Why no bonds? What about the sequence-of-returns risk? Well, if the sequence-of-returns is really good, then I am set for life. If it is really bad, then I will go back to work and top up. My career capital is my hedge against that risk. I can also reduce spending during hard times.

## Social Security

To qualify for social security, you need 10 years of work. My three weeks of work this month are enough to count as a whole year. This puts me at 9 years, so I will need to make 6K some year in the future. While I am not counting on social security, it would be nice. So I will do a gig or turn a profit on a hobby sometime between now and 65.

# About Life...

2020 was great financially, but otherwise terrible for me. I suffered from depression which was fueled by a cycle of stress from being behind at work causing me to get further behind at work. I already feel much better.

## Do I tell people I am retired?

A few people who are very familiar with my FIRE plans know that I am retired. Everyone else, I am telling that I am taking a one year break from the corporate world. I want to leave that door open, and one year may change my perspective.

## Goals and Hobbies

I need to lose some weight and get in better shape. I have also been single since the start of the pandemic and I do want a long-term partner. But I am not in a hurry. Being retired and single is the pinnacle of freedom.

I have two hobbies that might actually make me money. There is a website I am building, and super excited to launch. I am also designing some board games that I want to kickstart. The idea of making money on these is exciting because it would be purely disposable income. There is also a certain thrill of making something valuable enough that others are willing to pay for it.

I am not worried at all about being bored. There are places to hike/backpack, board games to play, friends to catch up with, places to visit, code to write, and so much more. For the first time in a long time, I am excited to wake up each morning!","self","https://redd.it/l4whet"

I've been trying to wrap my head around the Guyton-Klinger rules for withdrawals in retirement. For anyone not familiar, Guyton-Klinger is a method for adjusting your withdrawals in retirement according to the behavior of the market. It seems like a lot of people aim for the 4% rule in retirement but plan to cut back their spending during bear markets. Guyton-Klinger will systematize that strategy and also tell you the maximum you can safely spend every year while delivering a higher probability that your portfolio will outlive you than the 4% rule can deliver. 

Specifically, this passage has been giving me trouble:

 ""The portfolio management rule (PMR) determines the source(s) of each year's withdrawal.

* Following years where an asset class has a positive return that produced a weighting exceeding its target allocation, the excess allocation is sold and the proceeds invested in cash to meet future withdrawal requirements. 
* Portfolio withdrawals are funded in the following order: (1) overweighting in equity asset classes from the prior year-end, (2) overweighting in fixed income from the prior year-end, (3) cash, (4) withdrawals from remaining fixed-income assets, (5) withdrawals from remaining equity assets in order of the prior year's performance. 
* No withdrawals are taken from any equity following a year with a negative return if cash or fixed income assets are sufficient to fund the required withdrawal.""

Some of this seems redundant unless I'm misunderstanding something. Is it just poorly written? My interpretation is this:

* Always sell excess weighting of stocks/bonds if there was also a positive return. Use resulting cash for current and future withdrawals as needed.
* If sales from overweighting of stocks/bonds and cash reserve are insufficient to meet requirement for current withdrawal, sell bonds first and then stocks in order of best to worst-performing until requirement for withdrawal is met.

I'm trying to automate Guyton-Klinger in a spreadsheet and I think if I can get the Portfolio Management Rules (PMR) nice and clear I'll be able to finish it shortly. Help me out and I'd be happy to share the finished spreadsheet.

Since healthcare is, typically, an ever-increasing cost in USA, the older you get, how is this calculated into  typical I need $XXK/year FIRE formula? 

Before Medicare even kicks in, if you're now FIRED and no longer on an employer's insurance plan I'm guessing you're now buying an individual plan?

Let's say your annual premium as a 50 y.o. is 6K/year with a $6K deductible; before anything gets covered by health insurance. (And, God forbid, you get diagnosed with a serious illness in October then, of course, your deductible gets set right back to $0 in January.)

And if you get dementia, etc., when you're older than 50, say when your 75, Medicare will not pay for long-term health care. Long-term health insurance is incredibly expensive *if* a policy will even be written out for you and if it even covers beyond five years. Let's assume $3500/year/long-term health care premium, starting at age 65, for one person only. And say that policy coverage is only good for 5 years, which is typical, afterwards you could easily be spending$3-6K/month on care, out of pocket.

Is my thinking wildly off-base? I don't see how one is financially independent with a potential $6-12K/annual cost of health care and then the added possibility or overlap of long-term health care at, say, a FIRE of <60K/year. 

Help me understand. Are you planning on cashing out of your home and living in a senior community 1bedroom when your >50?","self","https://redd.it/l55nmf"

I have a great set of doctors (primary & specialists) in a city that is known for great healthcare & medical research.

Even though I've moved for work long ago, I've kept those doctors, and my workplace EPO & PPO plans cover them as all big insurances (Blue Cross, Aetna, UNH, Cigna) have nationwide networks.

However, ACA plans don't have nationwide access.

Are you maintaining primary residence in the States where their doctors are, for the sake of getting ACA coverage there?

Or are you  buying insurance in private market from one of the big companies and forgoing ACA? Which would also mean no-subsidy if you'd otherwise qualify","self","https://redd.it/l5g4kt"

Every so often someone would post here some article or column about how the fact that ""everyone is moving into index investing and how that would kill the market"", as there would be no untapped value stocks and no opportunity for growth .  There would be long discussions why this was or was not the case that would drag for days. Do you guys remember that?

While the Rules for posting questions on the basics of personal  finance/investing topics are more relaxed here, the rules against  memes/spam/self-promotion/excessive rudeness/politics still apply!

This month, I earned a good review at work, and decided I could start to coast a bit more and try to focus more on my mental health. However, my boss had a different plan. Suddenly, I have more pressure than ever to deliver multiple projects yesterday, and am at a loss for how to respond.

How do you use your FU money in practice? In my experience, at least 50% of bosses want to push their employees to give their jobs 110%. I always imagined when I got to this point that I would be able to coast with a more comfortable 80%-90% effort, but it seems most bosses put pressure on their employees to be as productive as humanely possible by any means necessary. The pressure has really started to affect me and I have considered quitting, but since quitting would delay my FIRE date, I would prefer to keep my job with a slightly reduced workload. I also have some fairly specialized skills on our team, which has resulted in me being the only person on our team able to deliver certain projects. I thought this would be good leverage too, but I'm not sure my non-technical boss will truly appreciate this fact until I'm gone.

How do you utilize your FU money to make yourself more comfortable at work, without setting yourself up to get additional pressure from your boss or labeled as an underachiever/candidate for the chopping block?","self","https://redd.it/l8rauv"

When I was a teenager, I had a talk with my parents regarding finances. I don’t know how we got to the following, but they said to me, “Yeah, you and your brother suck all the money from us, but we love y’all more than anything, and specifically, will do anything to give y’all a better life than your mother and I had growing up.”

In all seriousness, this really stuck with me. Ever since then, I’ve been incredibly frugal with my money. I’m 24, and a have a solid amount in savings (I think? With respect to other 24-year-olds… we can discuss this in the comments), and I’m actively planning for my future.

But then, comes the thought of having kids. I have NO idea if I even WANT kids. But, what if I do, maybe 10 years from now? Should I start accounting for my hypothetical kids, now?

Also, be honest with me: are the majority of y’all SINK/DINK? And/or working professional, white-collared jobs? After that conversation with them all those years ago, I had looked up “average investment in your child”, and holy CRAP, my parents were right. Goddamn, they weren’t joking. My brother and I were leeches on my parents.

So, kids… how do they fit into YOUR FIRE equation?

EDIT: Please feel free to ask me questions about my financials. I’ve created a budgeting spreadsheet when I started working full-time, and that has really helped me garner a better understanding of where I stand RIGHT now, but not with respect to everyone else.","self","https://redd.it/l9edcs"

Ok, now that that’s said…the official 2020 FI survey is now available and will remain open for responses until February 28. For those that are new here, this is a quasi-annual tradition for this sub. The last survey was done in [2018](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/6/d/1n2IpbpA_vGKSflRNuiRo-slvJdpptLfM/edit?usp=sheets_home&ths=true&rtpof=true). This post will be a bit long, so buckle up.

**What’s Different This Year?**

The most important difference this year is that ***ALL RESPONSE DATA WILL BE RELEASED IN A SPREADSHEET TO THE SUB***. If you’re not comfortable with that, don’t take the survey. Whenever possible, identifying information (such as age) is obscured in ranges. The survey does not ask for location, username, email, or other unique information, so your privacy is reasonably protected.

Because there are several numbers involved, last time people asked for a list of what numbers are needed. I’m delivering on that this time with a preparation spreadsheet that covers all the numbers you’ll be asked. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-GyDNwJmGchTNlS68rDBnAoZ6DdRoYF0sqsla56IYE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-GyDNwJmGchTNlS68rDBnAoZ6DdRoYF0sqsla56IYE/edit?usp=sharing)

A special 2020 Covid section has been added and a lot of the less popular sections from the last survey have been removed. It’s shorter than it was last time.

**Survey Instructions**

*These instructions are also available on the first screen of the survey, but you may want to keep this post open in a separate tab to refer back to them*\*\*\*.\*\*\* *Throughout the survey each section includes instructions at the top of the page as well.*

The survey will take 20-40 minutes to complete, depending on how prepared you are with your numbers.

Enter all annual information for calendar year 2020.  Enter all point in time data (like account balances) as of December 31, 2020 (or as close thereto as you can get).  Enter all amounts in current dollars (or your native currency).

Remember that personal finance is personal.  Enter your numbers as you interpret them, personally.  If you really get stuck, I will be watching the posting thread and answering interpretation questions as able.  Because personal finance is personal, some buckets may not be precisely consistent with your personal buckets.

The survey is long, and asks for a lot of information.  You can skip to the end to submit, which will then provide you a custom link to come back to your answers and edit them.  The survey will be available for the entire month of February.

If you are not in the United States, you can enter all ""dollar"" amounts in your native currency. Anywhere a question asks for ""dollar"" amounts, answer in your native currency.

Enter dollar amounts as a whole number, appropriately rounded.  E.G. $32,594.56 is entered as 32595, with no commas.

Enter percentages as a number, not a decimal. For example, 4% is entered as 4 (not .04), 20.5% is entered as 20.5 (not .205), etc.

Symbols for dollars ($) and percentages (%) are not needed.

Each question begins with an alphanumeric designation (e.g. A1, C3, F6).  At the end of the survey, you will be asked for any comments on the survey.  If you had issues with a question, please refer to it in your comments by the alphanumeric designation. Because the survey does not ask for identifying information, the survey team will not be able to follow up with you, so please be as specific as you can about the issue or difficulty you encountered.

The survey asks how many people contribute to your household finances, and thereafter your responses should include all assets, debt, etc. belonging to those people.  You determine the number of people who contribute to your finances. Demographic questions include demographics for ""contributor 2"" and ""contributor 3"", if you have more than one person contributing to your household income, you can include their demographic information there. Demographic questions are static, meaning further questions will ask about contributors 2 and 3 even if they do not exist for you - you can just leave those blank, or there is an N/A option if leaving it blank bothers you.

This survey asks for a lot of numbers. To completely fill it out, you will need to have the values of your investments, expenses, debt, and assets at hand, plus 2020 income and expenditures. A preparatory spreadsheet is available here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-GyDNwJmGchTNlS68rDBnAoZ6DdRoYF0sqsla56IYE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-GyDNwJmGchTNlS68rDBnAoZ6DdRoYF0sqsla56IYE/edit?usp=sharing)

Almost all questions are skippable; if a question does not apply to you or you haven't yet determined the answer, skip it.

That said, my current job is pretty chill, good work life balance and benefits - but I know I'll never get a +20% salary bump through raises/promotions at my current company. I'm not saying I wouldn't still *look* for the work/life balance perks in a new job, but it's always a gamble for it to pan out the way they tell you it will in the interviews.

I have three siblings, one who globe-trots automating factories, another flies Black Hawks, and the other is a smart, accomplished, hard-working auto mechanic. Two are married with six kids between them.

Meanwhile I worked my butt off from the my teenage years until my late 20's when I suddenly leanfired to just tend to my land lording duties and live a frugal life so that I could spend my time enjoying my hobbies. I live like a child, playing in rec sports leagues, going kayaking, skiing, biking in the woods, exploring nature, going to museums and local theater, making go-pro and drone videos, reading, playing with my cat. The life of leisure.

I was just reminded of a moment at a holiday dinner a couple of years ago I'd forgotten about. I'd never heard my dad give an opinion about how I live. If anything I thought maybe there was a subtle bit of disappointment that I wasn't using my education and talents to amass more wealth and status the way he would. But I figured if that is what he thinks, that's his problem.

My brother was saying he doesn't golf as much as he'd like because of how crowded his course was getting on the weekends. I said I usually go mid-morning during the week after I've met a friend for breakfast. The retired guys who play during the week like really early tee times so by 10 am the course is wide open.

My brother goes, ""Yeah, well, you can do that because you have nothing to do in your life.""

Before I could smile and say, ""Yeah, that's true."" My dad apparently got a little offended on my behalf and jumped to my defense:

""MaroonStriation doesn't owe anybody anything. He doesn't hurt anybody living the way he lives. He takes care of himself and that's all he needs to do.""

""Yeah, but I'm just saying..."", my brother tried to defend himself only to be interrupted.

Edit: So in hindsight this is way too long, but I'm gonna elucidate a bit below on the time I spent in the service industry, which I think was the most interesting part. since that is what really sets this apart from what I've seen around here. Directly below the July 2018 section.

TL;DR: Spent half the time living in work provided housing, half the time with my parents, saved something like 90%, invested consistently through the coronavirus “crash.”

No moonshots or windfalls per se. But an enormous amount of luck leveraged into opportunity. I can’t really tell anyone in my real life about this, as none of the really understand FI, but I figured someone might be able to get something out of this, and sometimes its good to just get stuff off my chest.

**1.** **Real quick, here is the level of privilege I got from my parents, so you don’t have to hunt for it:**

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

My parents helped me explicitly financially by paying my car insurance back when I was working in nonprofits (before the story begins. As soon as I got a job in 2017 I covered my own costs). Other than that, I lived in their home and ate their food for about 1.8 of the past 3.5 years. I also was homeschooled for a significant portion of my time growing up, which theoretically cost them quite a bit in reduced income by my mom not working, so you could make the argument that they implicitly spent a significant amount of money on my k-12 education. It was overall a good experience that I think has benefited me quite a bit. As far as I am aware, they don’t have any money, or at least any extra money beyond standard expenses. My extra curriculars were rec sports that I payed for myself as soon as I got a job, going to the library, and youth groups. Hopefully that paints a bit of the picture.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I figured this warranted its own thread for the following reasons that stand out a bit:

1. Did this all while working on my college Degree, so no degree yet.
2. Leveraged some tricks I see around here occasionally, but not all the time, and not really all at once ever that I have seen. (Work housing, scholarships playing a major part of my income, “high end” service industry job. TSP, CZTE, frontloading my Roth).
3. Feels like it happened stupid fast. Woulda hit even sooner (3 years flat) if I had played some of my cards better.
4. Did not get any inheritance money. (and never will, haha.)
5. I suppose some people will consider it important that I’m a minority, and a 2nd gen immigrant on one parent’s side. Other than that, my demographics are standard American dude.

**Next Paragraph is navel gazing, skip if you just want juicy details:**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why am I into FI: I don’t care about getting off the grid/out of the rat race, or not working, or any of the most common things I’ve seen on this forum. I am a deeply religious person (though arguably not of one of the common flavors of religion), and most of my goals are based around a sort of religious altruism.

I wanted to find the most optimal way to complete these things, and I’ve decided(for what I see right now) that being in a place of financial security is likely the best scenario for me to be able to pivot into the positions on projects that I want to be. Volunteering rather than working for a religious org seems to give you significantly more power, and the ability to tango with the ""administrative"" side of things, rather than having to necessarily do what they say. (I'm a bit more openminded than a significant portion of my peers here, so take that as you will.) I recognize that it is in many ways probably a fantasy, but I figure if I shoot for making these goals a reality, I will at least get some of them done.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**On to the details:**

Got my first job in high school making $7.25 per hour, about 2 years of that over the course of which I received two raises, completing high school making $8.50. I was always a bit of a saver, so I just stashed almost everything I made in a savings account. My parents never really taught me how budgeting or finance worked (They didn’t/do not exactly know themselves) so almost everything I got at the time was from Art of Manliness articles.

**Graduated HS with $4,000.**

Worked in non profits for several years, during which I made very little money(read 100 bucks per month), but had all my expenses covered by the nature of the work. I was planning on doing this long term, but eventually they told me I needed to go start being an adult and having a real job or going to college, so I did that around Summer 2017.

**Summer 2017: hadn’t made or lost any money, had about $4,000.**

Joined a reserve component of the military that summer and started a new service industry job that was heavily tip based. It turns out working in non profits had made me a pretty good salesman/people person, so my average take home for the rest of the year was about $16 per hour. I spent the semester working, going to college, and waiting for the military to give me tech school dates. I had moved back in with my parents, so had very small expenses, I paid them about $150 per month in rent/utilities/food. Wasn’t a great situation, as their home is small and several other people lived there, but I made the most of it with half a bedroom to myself, and the price made it worth it.

School costs were paid for by scholarships that my state offers to anyone with good enough grades. I’m amazed that this isn’t more well known, but you can go to school basically for free if you maintain a 3.0 GPA in at least one state, and probably more.

Went to basic training that January, and saved all of the money I made from that, about 3k. When I got home, over the summer I continued to work.

**July 2018: \~$14,000.**

Purchased a car outright for $9500. In hindsight, may not have been the most financially savvy decision, but I was very anti loan at the time, so that was the best decision I could think of. I did get way better at my service industry job around this time, so I was pulling in closer to 20 per hour. It was around this time I started to learn more about how stocks and index funds worked, and began to think about investing.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Some expanded details on that service industry job:**

Zero prerequisite experience. They basically take anyone with a pulse. It's a bit niche, as jobs like this only really exists in tourist towns, but they can be extremely lucrative if pursued carefully. I realized as I got better at the job that the main reason other people who did it were broke is that they spent all of their money on weed. With focus and self control, it was a great way to make and keep money. 

Some more particular numbers, and I know in other cities you can make even more than this, this was a MCOL area. 

On the weekends I made close to 30 per hour, it was dragged down to an average of 20 by weeknight work.

I only worked 32 hours per week, and only about 3 weekends per month. Someone doing what I did full time would make probably around 3500-4000 per month before taxes. This is in an area where you can get a fairly nice 1 bedroom for about 800 per month, and with roommates can easily spend about 3 or 400 on housing. 

Worth looking into this stuff if you:

1. Don't have a great and steady career yet.
2. Live in a historic/touristy/populous city. 
3. Are good with people/know how to learn how to get better with people.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

By December I was back up to like 13,000 and around that time I was activated for a military duty that ended up lasting about a year and a half, into this present Juneish. During that time, I completed military technical school, worked for my unit, went on several TDY’s and a deployment. Between the deployment and the TDY’s, I made bank off of per diem and extra incentive pays, not to mention tax free money. I aggressively started putting money into my TSP around August 2019, and also began to put money into my Roth IRA. I fund basically via a total stock market index, buy, and forget about it.

I think my average take home over the course of that year and a half was about 4k per month, and I saved almost everything except for a few random purchases, and sent my parents a bit of rent money as well. This snowballed me quite a bit, kept investing through the coronavirus/oil malarkey drop early 2020, and benefited from the rebound.

**July 2020: 85,000.**

I got off active duty and started going back to school in the fall, and received a bonus I had enlisted for, netting about 7500. I also was awarded an extremely generous scholarship that included living expenses of around 1600 per month after tax, and was making a drill paycheck of around 250 per month.

I stayed at home as long as I could stand, and finally moved out in November. By this time, I was just under 100K, and then stonks kept going up, and I hit 100 around mid December. Since I’ve moved out, I’m not saving anywhere near as aggressively, but I don’t feel like I need to. I’m keeping my expenses low, and will graduate soon into a job where I’ll be making 60-80k in a MCOL area. I figure with my current yearly expenses, that will be plenty to coast Fi, but I don’t have a particular outcome in mind just yet. I want to see where the chips fly as far as career and family take me, so I’ll see where things go from there.

**December 2020: 101,000**

Yup, that's about it. I'll try to answer any questions if anyone has questions about this ridiculous thing that happened to me. I've deliberately changed a few details for the theoretical sake of anonymity, but I don't think they are anything numbers related.","self","https://redd.it/lbtbe1"

Consider the military.

My wife and I are both 23 and our household income is 130k a year. Our combined NW is 170k. 0 debt. It's not an insane number until you look at some facts: About 45% of this is untaxed (housing, food stipends). We get 5% matching on very low fee TSP(401K) contributions. We spend $0 for healthcare and have never had issues with the service. 

The real kickers:

Both of us have degrees from well-known and respected universities, but at this moment we are still enlisted (long story). Neither of us have used our GI bill benefits, and between the 2 of us have 72 months of paid college+housing to keep for ourselves or pass to future children.

Neither of us are over E5 rank (Up to E4 is guaranteed with some time in service), so its not like we are super hard chargers or running entire military programs. We work about 30 hours a week each (and MUCH less with covid), come home and hang out in a nice apartment and play video games or do whatever. 30 days paid leave every year is nice too. 

We are not in super long contracts. One 6 year and one 4 year. If we stay in (would go officer) for another 15 years we would get a combined pension of about 80k a year and free healthcare for the rest of forever, entirely independent from any retirement accounts or personal savings/investments.

It's not always easy, but we've gotten to see some truly amazing places and have literally never had any financial concerns. We live off of about $2500 a month for the 2 of us and if we made 2x as much as we currently do, our lifestyle wouldn't change much (we don't budget super hard or buy cheap food).

This option is open to a lot of young people. Not everyone gets as lucky as we did and not everyone could stand the military life even if it paid 1mil a year (grooming standards, fitness, 24/7 availability to texts and phone calls) but I think a lot of people are unjustly turned off when they see the military pay chart that excludes extra allowances and pay.","self","https://redd.it/ldegqt"

Pre-COVID I drove maybe 2-3x a month. Since COVID, I've been driving about once every 2-3 months, with a notable exception that my gf (of 15 years) has a car she drives every day and we've transitioned to using it as our primary transportation. My vehicle is much more luxury/comfort (Lincoln) and hers is much more econ/utility (Subaru.) That said, even if I *were* single and driving every time I needed to, it'd still be only once or twice a month. 

As a result, I've put my car into storage and I'm seriously considering selling it to a dealer to minimize the hassle even though I won't absolutely maximize my profit. Doing the math, the monthly cost of insurance (out of storage) at an expected ~1,000 miles a year is still considerably more than the cost of an Uber on the rare occasion I would need to drive somewhere, assuming I didn't have my gf's car available. With her car, it's just no question - I can Uber in a pinch or just wait for a convenient time. I'm not reliant on her for transport, though I am reliant on the services industry (Uber) to continue functioning. That last factor is the main reason I'm considering *not* selling, but given the financial benefit I think I'm likely to do so anyway (and call a friend in an emergency.)

My savings will be about $80 a month in insurance, maybe $200 a year in gas, another ~$200 a year in registration fees, inspections, and whatnot. I get to maintain insurance that allows me to drive *other people's* cars, and I still have to update my license every five years, but I *could* do away with those if I wasn't going to drive at all, and save... oh, maybe an average of another $100 a year. My initial FIRE plans definitely factored in paying for personal access to transportation, but with my (admittedly minimal) needs and local factors, it turns out my transportation costs are significantly lower. I'm not sure I'd have realized this without COVID forcing me to look at how much my car sits parked, and how easy it is to consolidate to one vehicle in my household.

I don't often see posts about how costs sometimes go *down* post-FIRE, so I thought this might be an interesting read. If not, thanks for coming by anyway!

Post-Scrip: I usually get questions whenever I post on this sub about how I FIRE/d with the stats in my flair. The short answer is: I got pretty lucky and did some smart things. The medium-er answer is: I graduated early, leveraged employer-paid education while working in some reasonably well-paid fields such as manufacturing, engineering and military contracting. I saved and invested everything I could at every opportunity (aside from a massive food bill from how physically active I was.) I had good mentors and education, specifically on personal finance, and (if I may) reasonably good instincts. After saving and investing for awhile I tried my hand at personal real estate investing, created an LLC and spent about a decade at it (I counted myself FIRE while I was still doing this; I had basically hired a team that handled it for me while I sat back and enjoyed the benefits.) I came out ahead, but not by nearly as much as I wanted to, pulled everything out (sold what I could and took losses where I had to) and put it all into a managed investment account where it mostly sits and grows today. My health took a turn for the worse due to some work-related issues which influenced some of the timing on my FIRE and resulted in a much lower FIRE # than I initially anticipated. I now count that as a blessing because it turns out it was enough and I might have still been stuck in the ""just save more"" loop even now if I hadn't had strong encouragement to get out when I did.

Notably, I'm not a software developer, I didn't get lucky with stocks, digital currency or anything crazy like that. I didn't work for a startup unless you count my own LLC. I haven't inherited a cent from family, and don't expect to. FIRE doesn't require those ""typical"" paths, but there's a reason they are typical paths: they tend to work, at least in the current circumstances. Good luck to you guys out there!

**Small edits to clarify some details.**

**TL;DR: I don't drive nearly as much as I did when I was working, and the math tells me paying for an Uber 2-4x a month is considerably cheaper than the cost of maintaining insurance, registration, maintenance, etc. on a paid-off vehicle.**","self","https://redd.it/ldrvyv"

I originally wondered how long it would take before you can see the exponential increase due to compound growth in a real setting.  From my original post, you can barely make out a slope.

Here is a follow up to this post [updated for 2/2021](https://imgur.com/a/wKDqPYY).

You can clearly see the impacts of the pandemic on my net worth growth. However, as I remained almost fully invested, my NW recovered and then some. This time you can clearly see a nice curve to the growth rate (and the impact of compounding)

[Another view](https://imgur.com/a/WbBASgm) \- this chart is my NW over time with the growth rate in % on the Left Y axis. The red line is month to month change in absolute numbers. In general, you can see that as time passes, the % change per month decreases even though the month to month change seems to increases. As my monthly contributions were fairly steady, this is directly related to compound growth.  You can see more significant changes in %/absolute numbers in 2020, but a large component is due to the volatility we saw in 2020.

For those starting out, note that the largest impact is consistently contributing to savings - this makes the largest impact starting out before compounding growth takes over (ie: the past 2 years, i was able grow at greater than my take home pay) ... but it took 7 YEARS of contributing consistently before you start seeing any impact of compound growth. My income has changed less than 1% / year over the past 7 years, so that did not play a significant impact.  This curve should be the same for pretty much anyone regardless of your net worth (from $100 to $10M+... the biggest change to the growth would be if you were able to slowly add MORE contributions monthly due to raises and your personal rate of return depending on your investment choices and where we are in the business cycle.","self","https://redd.it/lee7d0"

In short:  unsolicited advice is generally not appreciated.

A brief tangential moment before I get to the point:  I have some underlying health issues (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, elevated triglycerides).  I am not a morbidly obese person although I could stand to lose 10-15 lbs.  

What I have noticed is a few people in my life eating a lot better than me, exercising regularly.  And much like the FIRE wisdom of not trying to put people on our financial pathway, they might briefly mention their diet or fitness program but they don’t push it on me.  

I am making some early progress on improving my diet and hope to incorporate an exercise regimen as well.  I consider this as something I need to take a deep dive into learning more just as I have for years with FIRE (although now I am more on autopilot with FIRE related things)

Financial Independence is deeply personal: It looks different every time. We need to respect that.","None",0.93,3418,0,24,512,1,"Personal Finance is Personal.  FIRE is even more so: It's personal finance multiplied, magnified, extended.

As someone who's been on this sub for nearly a  decade, it's suddenly started to feel mean.

After seeing someone just delete a long, informative, interesting post (***and*** their entire reddit account) in this subreddit, we need to talk about how petty and negative this sub has gotten.  

FIRE is inherently optimistic: It's the belief that you can make enough to cover significantly more than your expenses, then use that difference to get a return on investments to support the consumption of an entire family, forever.  It pushes people to reach towards things that might be out of their grasp.  There are all different levels of how conservative or risky people are, but when someone takes a different approach than you, that does *not mean* that they aren't also pursing FIRE in just as valid a way as you.

The daily threads lately have had a lot of sniping in them; they're conversation threads and are there to specifically be for small things, easy things, even 'dumb' things.  

When someone posts about how they retired with a million dollars and $40k in expenses (The quintessential 4% rule, that may be too conservative for you, or may be too risky) there is rampant negativity across the board: It's not just disagreement about numbers or assumptions, it is a absolute disrespect for anyone living a different lifestyle.  The number of people that have told me lately that I am living a broken, destitute life because my wife and I live - and thrive - on $30k a year is insane.

If you're FatFIRE you saved too much and are a glutton. LeanFIRE and you'll live a miserable life. Have a sidegig and you failed at retirement, not have a side gig and you'll run out of money in no time flat. Got a windfall in any way and you shouldn't even post your story, have a difficult start and you're probably lying.  FIRE in your 20's and it's way too early, in your late 50's and it's not even FIRE.  Not have kids and you're missing life, have kids and you're a fool.  3.5% and you're working longer than you'll need to, 4% and you'll go broke.  Don't pay off your house and you're a fool: pay off your house? Also a fool. 

This should be a place where any one of those things in the paragraph above should be an absolutely acceptable way to be or become FI.

This isn't to say we can't disagree! I've posted a lot about my numbers, my assumptions, and why I would or wouldn't do what someone else is.  I see a *lot* of people doing things I would never dream of.  But we can't tear eachother down just because it's a path we wouldn't have taken.  

This sub is the only place a lot of us can talk about FIRE stuff, it needs to be a positive, accepting place.

Edit:  I didn't mean to give the impression that we shouldn't disagree.  I honestly learn best through discussion and being proven wrong.  Just that you don't need to belittle someone or be toxic in a disagreement.","self","https://redd.it/lfj46n"

FU money 6 yrs ago, FI target 2-3 yrs 

TLDR: Hacks in order of rarity: 1) Decrease income to pay for college; 2) Homeschool; 3) Start a small business

I stopped full-time work at 40, to travel with the family and to be more deliberate about our remaining time with our kids, even though we were not at full FI. Mrs. Redraidr and I used one year's planned expenses to travel RTW for ~8 months with kids aged 12 & 15, then settled down for them to go to HS while we developed our hobby into a paying side gig. We now have one in college and one soon to be (if that’s her choice). More importantly, we didn’t miss any major events in our teenagers’ lives, and have attended virtually every extracurricular activity. We offset withdrawals with side-gig $, so the bulk of the investments still grow. Thought I’d share a few hacks that have allowed this, in case anyone else in the community can use or improve on them, in the order that I think I hear them the least.

1)	Decrease income during FAFSA years - 

There’s a lot of talk about decreasing income during retirement/drawdown years to minimize impact on taxation, and this makes sense. What we did differently, I think, was that even though we had not really hit FI numbers, we reduced our income in years during which college financial aid is calculated, even though we could be earning higher wages. During high-savings-rate years, our household income ranged from $50-$110k. We now show only $40k in income. FAFSA looks back 2 years, so you have to start before your child is a junior in HS, but the difference can be huge. With college costs from $20-90k annually, our Expected Family Contribution is now around $3000. This means that government grants apply to us, and that the colleges themselves often slash the price by 50% or more. Our first child attends a college with a published total cost of attendance of $80,000 per year, so $320k over 4 years. Our cost will be around $20,000 over 4 years. That’s a savings that exceeds lost income, and we are not working full-time to get it. Most important takeaway is that aid is mostly tied to income, while 401k’s, Trad IRAs, and Roth IRAs are not considered in the aid calculation, even though Trad IRAs and Roth contributions can be used without penalty for college. So our FI nest egg is effectively invisible to colleges. 529's are not invisible and do have impact, as do post-tax investments and checking/savings. Note- not a financial advisor, just a parent. Get pro advice. 

2)	Homeschool - 

There’s probably a lot of info out there on this one, but I’ll add my two cents. We homeschooled/road-schooled for 5 years. We cut the costs of maintaining two professionals. Since Mrs. RR was not tied to a job, I was able to chase income, wherever it was, and we moved often. We were able to minimize to reduce transporting of unnecessary stuff. We didn’t have to pay for childcare. Homecooked meals and prepped lunches cut food costs. It was in one spot for two years. It was with a travelling job for 18 months (we all went wherever the job was, and used that area to supplement the curriculum). When we travelled around the world for 8 months without working, experiential learning went through the roof. We could also then study the map and use geoarbitrage to choose a LCOL where we would settle for a while and send our kids to HS and start a small business.

3)	Own a business or farm (even a small one) - 

Since I’m way long here, I’ll abbreviate this well-known hack. We knew our hobby had the potential to be monetized, and it ultimately was, but the main point was to choose our own hours. We received that benefit, but much more. I’ll list a few that all have major implications: 1) Manipulatable income (e.g., hack #1 above) which is why the side gig number has an *, 2) Reinvesting into the business for $$ at sale, 3) Depreciation of assets for tax purposes, 4) Company vehicle, 5) Kids earning wages (again, *).

*Manipulatable income for various reasons & implications


I’m super long here, so I’ll stop. Any comments are welcome. Glad to have found this sub.","self","https://redd.it/lfm566"

I do have feelings about if this should/ needs to happen, but I’m more interested in what people think the ramifications of it will be to them regarding FIRE. For me I live in a low cost of living area, but work in a higher COL area. This has both allowed me to save more each year, but also plan on spending less post FIRE. My state is one of many that still uses the federal $7.25 min wage, and my understanding is that many jobs in my area do pay less then $10. Because of this I could see the COL in my area going up significantly if this was to change. This would obviously also change my FIRE number, and I don’t see that investments would necessarily increase at the same rate. If you are still working you might see a pay increase, but if you are making say above $50k a year I wouldn’t count on it. Still not the end of the world, since you still adjust your time frame to RE. But if one had already FIRE’d I could see this being a much bigger deal, possibly even bigger then a bad “sequence of returns” event at the beginning of retirement.
Now this is for me living in a LCOL area, I’m guessing that those that live, and plan to stay living in a HCOL area will see far less effect from this. But it will be interesting to see. What are other’s thoughts on this?
The above was what I originally posted on Saturday, and had it automoderated down, after some suggestions I’m resubmitting with the added info.  

While I was thinking of this a bit more abstractly, I did have a suggestion to mention some of the specifics since there is an actual bill in play. I think this a good run down of the bill in the house. https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2021-01-26%20Raise%20the%20Wage%20Act%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf
And coincidentally today the CBO released there analysis of the effects said bill would have on the economy. Quite a bit of the analysis seems to be more about the overall economy, but it does bring up the costs of goods going up.
https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56975?utm_source=feedblitz&utm_medium=FeedBlitzEmail&utm_content=812526&utm_campaign=Express_2021-02-08_11:30:00&utm_medium=FeedBlitzEmail&utm_content=812526&utm_campaign=Express_2021-02-08_11:30:00

I’m still more curious what effects people think this will have on an individual level, and specifically related to FIRE. But I think the broader discussion about how this would effect the economy, and society in general is also interesting and worth while.","self","https://redd.it/lfny4x"

I don't have a house yet, but it's a goal I'm building toward. I've heard that some of the big winners (at least in the United States) will be in places such as Seattle, Minneapolis, and Buffalo.

Big losers are going to be Florida, the South, and Southern California. How are you--if you are--factoring this into your plans to achieve FIRE? And to keep your FIRE as sustainable as possible?

Ever since, I’ve felt some sort of disconnect or judged from my friends as they view landlords as “leeches” who are just making housing unaffordable. I grew up in a low income area and a lot of my friends are high school friends, so I do get where they’re coming from. I worked really hard as well as a couple of side hustles to come up with this down payment and also had to buy hours away because it was the only thing I could afford but I saw potential there. It really makes me sad because I had a vision of expanding my real estate portfolio and feel like it’ll be a big part of my life going forward. Do I just not share this info with them? Anyone else felt this way or have any advice?

I plan to FIRE in 10 years at the age of 35 - I’ve been really invested in stocks and options right now and I feel like I don’t really have that in common with them as well. I did try to explain to them about the more basic stuff like ETFs, mutual funds, etc but they see it as gambling... and rather keep everything in cash. I know it’s not my place to tell them where to put their money but I just thought that we’d be able to have more in common once they see the effect of their money growing. I’ve been friends with some of them for 10 years so I know they’re really caring and supportive.

Edit: ahh thanks for all the responses. I’m overwhelmed lol also, I don’t discuss the exact money part with my friends. They just know that I have a house and that I’m renting it out (I had told them this initially not knowing their reaction). I think the most recent situation was that my house had a massive leak and I was pretty stressed, missed a couple of hangouts and I felt like I couldn’t tell them the real reason I couldn’t make it without feeling weird about it - I had to make up some other excuse. Also, I’m a girl for those who keep calling me “dude” in PMs lol","self","https://redd.it/lhd6sb"

It was the end of the year so I didn't tell anyone because I was expecting a tax bill that would set me back below the 1M mark. However, since then I have surpassed 1M far enough that even after I pay taxes, I will still be over 1M by a good amount (unless, of course, the market takes a nosedive). I'm planning to work a few more years, but should I get fired, I may just become Uber driver/work part-time.

At this point, if someone asks me, I wouldn't lie, but I feel hesitant to tell anyone I've achieved this goal out of fear that they will expect me to pay for stuff or ask for money, etc. I don't think most people will understand that I have a specific goal in mind and I plan to retire earlier than most people. They will say ""you can afford to work a couple extra years so you can afford to come play golf with us, or get XYZ a more expensive wedding/birthday gift, get this expensive gym membership, etc."" On the other hand, I want to celebrate and tell everyone! This is a huge milestone.

Worst case scenario would be my parents asking me for money... which I don't think they'll do outright, but my family has a way of ""expecting"" things when one person has more than the others - for example, my older sister who lives in NYC, but was staying in my mom's house for the pandemic just expected that she could borrow my car for an 800 mile road trip to her friends house without offering to pay so much as $20 and threw a fit when I said no even though I'm working from home and don't need it... TBH I will probably avoid telling my family for as long as I can - I'm more concerned about telling friends.

$1M is a lot to some people, but I'm only 30 so I have to make it last a really long time (hopefully). I have no kids, but want some, and am not married so I have a lot of potential upcoming expenses when the time comes. 1M is not enough to go around for the 50+ years I have left on this earth.

I knew prices have sky rocketed since then, through Zillow and neighbors.  Of course I know better than to rely on such anecdotal evidence.

Recently however, we decided to refinance and as part of the process we need to get an appraisal done.  The appraisal returned a price 40% more than we paid less than a year ago.  I was happy, but thought this was a fluke and didn't think much of it.  Our broker required a second appraisal due to the size of the loan (or at least that's what I was told), at no cost to us, and that appraisal returned a price 45% higher than what we paid.  I contacted my agent who said he could sell it for even higher and the appraisal barely even matters as cash buyers, mainly from CA, are waiving all contingencies in my area.  This is all so crazy to me as it hasn't even been a year since we bought.

I am so tempted to sell and rent for a little bit, as this would significantly accelerate my FIRE journey.

At least read the whole wall of text before you send another one of my posts to the great beyond.

I am in the middle of my annual re-read of NNT’s books, so I am already sensitive about people obsessed with predicting the future to 2 decimal places. But lately I have noticed more bad advice and shitty comments than I can handle, so I am going to rant about a couple things.

I love u/billbengen for giving us the idea of a rigorous data-driven assessment of whether people might have “enough” in retirement through his initial work on Safe Withdrawal Rates. Before Bill, there was chaos and shitty advice from people who did not usually have retirees’ best interests in mind. He gave an excellent objective way of showing people the reality of their financial situation.

But Bill created a monster in a small corner of the internet: some people in r/FI have now misinterpreted Bill’s general rule of thumb as one of the laws of the universe. (I am pretty sure he frowns on these fanatic disciples as well).

The whole point of assessing whether you have enough for retirement is to avoid the risk of “blowing up” your portfolio. Bill’s genius was showing people that if you look at the past, there is a portfolio value and composition where, all else being equal (literally everything, which I will cover later), you could spend a consistent amount each year and would not have run out of money despite all the crazy shit that happened in the 20th century. He laid it all out in detail. It is beautiful.

The future is uncertain though. There will never be another 1930’s depression, or 1970’s stagflation crisis (the periods that kill most SWR scenarios). Instead, they will be replaced with some new and frightening (though possibly similar) “Black Swan” that nobody is predicting right now. Look closely at the data used to calculate safe withdrawal rates, and you will see that the risks to your future retirement are ever-present and lurk just beneath the surface of the placid declarations that “your retirement is 100% safe at a 3.2% SWR.” More on this in a minute.

(Also, shout-out to all the heroes running retirement simulator websites – check the sidebar – that let people see the actual data underlying SWR calculations. You are doing God’s work.)

The fact that no SWR value incorporates the “sequence of expenditures” risk is also annoying. People obsess over withdrawal rates because there are oodles of data available for market returns. I would argue that an equally big risk with even less certainty is size and profile of future expenditures. No, you do not often see the wild swings in expenditures that you do in market returns (usually), but for most people approaching big lifestyle changes, there is definitely going to be some change and there are way fewer data points available on the volatility of your particular future spending needs. Most people will unexpected need to replace a car, or fix a roof, or pay a medical bill, or help an aging parent, or something like that. It probably won't happen on schedule and might happen at the bottom of a bear market. Many borderline SWRs will die if something happens at an inopportune time in the business cycle. It is challenging to usefully model in a slick tool though (maybe a Monte Carlo sim with user-dictated probability and value ranges for various events? Nevermind).

So, why I am getting all worked up about this trivial crisis of the SWRs. Well, mostly because it appears to be making some people miserable. It can’t say for sure, but I have a gut feel that part of the reason is the artificial specificity of the whole concept of the Safe Withdrawal Rate. 

* People working extra years in a job they hate to get from a 4% SWR to a 3% in order to have some extra sense of security that could be achieved with less misery by looking at other options.
* People who obsessively get to that specific number, retire, then look around and realize, “oh shit, I am miserable.” But now they have even less social interaction than they did in their jobs they hated, they don’t have a partner because they couldn’t find someone equally obsessive, and they definitely don’t have any leaching dependents or money-wasting hobbies. So they go to a therapist to figure out what the hell happened.
* People that are so obsessed with the ultimate, adamantium, end-of-universe-proof withdrawal rate that they bitterly leap on the latest LeanFI risk taker to insist not only are they a terribly reckless human being, but they are guaranteed to be miserable in life. Or worse, that they are a dirty little liar and are secretly still working somehow!

I have this hunch that these people would be happier in life if they looked more closely at what an SWR actually proposes to be. What does a SWR success rate represent? The probability that a portfolio of a given size and composition would go to zero assuming (in descending order of importance and increasing level of control),

1. The future securities markets will exactly follow one of the combination of sequences that we saw in the 20th century;
2. The individual resides in - and only invest in - the United States (or maybe Canada or Australia);
3. The individual’s expenditures will not vary from a target spend except for historic inflation over that period; and
4. They will not live one day longer than the retirement period they plan for.

Each of those assumptions includes a component of insanity. Will the next 30, 40 or 50 years be an exact replica of some similar duration time sequence in the last 130 years? No, otherwise we have a guaranteed way to get rich by timing the market. Does everyone reside in and invest in the United States? No, build a wall! Will someone’s spending only vary with inflation in retirement? Seems pretty improbable, but maybe. Will someone die exactly on schedule at the end of the period when they run out of money? Well, I guess you could make that happen, but it sounds unpleasant.

I love the way SWRs are used by most of the Financial Independence community to encourage people to visualize and build financial resilience with super-practical and well supported advice to reassure people looking to one day get out of the daily grind or at least free them from money stress a bit. 

I hate how it turns some people into unpleasant trolls that encourage obsessive focus on a single number as though that is the only path to happiness and nirvana. Humans are resilient and literally every human life is different. Just chill and be happy for risk takers so long as they are making an informed choice.

I hate how it gets people in their mid-20s depressed about how they will take 30 years to reach their “early retirement number” (“AnD wHaT aBoUt HeAlTh InSuRaNcE??? iT’s HoPeLeSs!!!”). No matter how many years it takes to get to “retirement,” you will enjoy your life more from a position of financial stability built up intentionally in a boring manner than if you borrowed money for every purchase in life with no savings, and became dependent on every dollar, of every paycheck, every month in order to avoid ruin. And for the record: retiring at 55 isn’t so bad. And if you hate your job, you need to fix that sooner rather than later.

I hate how people who almost certainly have plenty of money will regardless keep working for another year because of some bullshit CAPE ratio and how that means that some idiot at some bank decided that the next 30 years will have lower expected investment returns. If you are tired of your job, quit (sorry, retire). Instead, spend that year coming up with a game plan for something potentially economically useful that you could do to fill the gap in response to an economic disaster. But for the love of Zeus, please don’t keep working because of how some asshole’s forecast impacts the decimal places in your over-modelled withdrawal rate. Just a reminder: retirees DO NOT CARE ABOUT AVERAGE RETURNS! They care about sequence of returns, and all economic forecasters are terrible at projecting anything as useful as that. Don’t rely on them. Come up with a contingency plan instead.

Life is extremely uncertain and ruled by crazy events that will impact your retirement game plan in a way that literally cannot be predicted to even the nearest percentage point (let alone tenth or hundredth of a percentage point). Use SWRs to objectively look at how bad things might get, consider realistic and adaptable contingency plans based on the relative risk of your number, and then enjoy life. But don’t be a slave to your SWR.

Ok u/pianojosh (or I guess u/Hold_onto_yer_butts), you can delete this now if you hate it. Yes, I know, everything I said above is basically laid out in the FAQ. But apparently not everyone reads that, and it is making me sad. So I am helping get the message out, right? And if you, dear readers, think the mods should delete this post, please downvote immediately and tell me why (so that I can adapt and learn before the post disappears). Then I will wander back to lurking in r/fijerk.

With Social Security included, we *may* wind up with non-adjustable retirement income being as high or higher than during our working years. To me, that tilts the scales in favor of Roth 457(b) contributions. If we were to build up a large Traditional balance, the RMDs would be painful.

Ideally, we'll be in a position to RE by age 50. This could provide opportunities to convert some or most of the Traditional balance. I still feel a bit uneasy, though. I can't help but feel that I'm giving up something I can control (contributing at my known current tax rate) for the hope of a more favorable environment in the future. Obviously, tax rates could be higher in the future, but I also may end up working until age 62, with the pension starting in that year. There's a fair chance that I would lose those years of conversion to an unforeseen circumstance that forces me to keep working: college bills for our newborn, a health issue, etc. There are countless people who plan to retire early but just can't do it for a variety of reasons. I suppose the counter argument to that is that many people *are* forced to retire early, in which case I would have some time to convert the Traditional balances.

There's almost a comfort in knowing that by contributing to Roth now, I lock in the tax-free growth and I won't need to play the conversion game in the future. But, it's painful to pay both federal and state income tax on our full salaries (we have no deductions available other than the SD).

One thing to note: if one of us were to take a private sector job, or our pensions were suddenly cut in half, I would absolutely go Traditional.

Am I a little crazy, or does this sound reasonable? Thank you all.","self","https://redd.it/lmmgzv"

Always envisioned moving to some tropical paradise like Bali. At 30, currently have a liquid net worth of 521K and was on the way to hit 1M by 35. 

However, life threw me a curveball recently. The health of my parents rapidly declined and they are no longer able to support themselves financially completely without completely plundering their retirement accounts (which is already very modest). They never explicitly asked for help, but that’s because they never would.

I recently moved back to my parent’s home at 30 to help them financially and took over the mortgage payments to start. My parents have 208K left on the mortgage - $2700 monthly payments and the loan is for 21 more years. Add in the rest of living expenses and my monthly take home pay is all but gone.

There are two conflicting sides to me - brain and heart. One side that’s more logical says $2700/month invested at an average return of 7% over 21 years is 1.5M. The other side that’s more emotional says it’s your own mother and father...they sacrificed everything as first generation immigrants to provide you an opportunity at the American dream. For pretty much all of my big life decisions, the brain has won in the past. For this big life decision, the choice is easy. 

What is the purpose of money if you don’t use it to take care of or improve the lives of those you love? 

I don’t know why I feel compelled to share this here (probably because I have no one to talk to this about), but all I can say is life happens when you’re busy making other plans. And hug your parents and tell them you love them because they are only getting older.","self","https://redd.it/ln4s6r"

Take, for example, how each class thinks about possessions:

* In the working, middle, and upper-middle classes, you think of your possessions in terms of **things.** Houses, cash, stocks, cars. This is what composes your net worth, and that's what separates you from the working poor. Your things are your nest egg. Your things could make you FI.
* In generational wealth, you possess **one-of-a-kind objects.** Think original art, family heirlooms, paintings that you commissioned directly from the artist, etc. You acquire things that your friends couldn't have an identical one even if they wanted to. That's what separates you from the point system of the middle and upper-middle classes, where everyone is competing to see who has the bigger SUV, or whatever. 

But in poor communities, Dr. Payne says that the poor think of **people** as their possessions. When I first read this, it flew over my head...I had zero clue of what she was even talking about. Possessing people? What? But then I thought more about it in the context of my own childhood surrounded by the working poor, and it started to make sense...because it's exactly how I was bought up.

I think about my first girlfriend in high school, who called me ""her man."" I was too young to realize it at the time, but that wasn't a term of endearment -- she meant it literally. I was ""her man,"" and she was ""my woman."" I was taught I was supposed to ""provide"" for her, and she was expected to ""stand by"" me. Her parents taught her to value her relationship with me over school, because their hidden rule recognized that in poverty, work isn't what ensures your survival (it doesn't pay enough to.) Relationships ensure your survival. If your car breaks down, you can't afford to just call AAA. You have to call your daddy's buddy that knows a guy who went to school with a lady who's friends with the weird guy from Bible study who keeps jumper cables in his car...and you better hope and pray that the weird guy likes you enough to take time out of his busy day to jump your car. Because if he doesn't, have fun paying that tow bill.

Thinking about it in raw terms...that's what I hate about having grown up in the working poor, and it's what drives me towards FI. I'm nobody's ""man."" I hate the idea of belonging to somebody. I honestly don't know what I was put on this earth to do, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't to be a protector or a provider for ""my woman"", and I'd like to think she had a bigger purpose than ""standing by"" me. I hate the idea that my success or failure would be determined by what other people think of me, instead of being determined by what I can achieve -- which is the middle-class hidden rule, and the one that leads most FIers to their goal.

But honestly, that upbringing is also what makes developing a FIRE mindset so foreign to me. I wasn't even led to believe FI could even be a *thing.* I remember seeing my Roth IRA break four figures for the first time: seeing a comma in the number, and instead of being proud, being *scared.* I had no idea what to do next. I never thought I'd get that far...and thinking that something was going to happen that I'd lose it. It took a conscious effort to look at the way I think about money, life, work, and relationships, and re-frame what they all mean to me. It's been scary and transformative. But I'm ready for the next chapter.","self","https://redd.it/ln5vmw"

My wife FIRE'ed last year. It has not quite sunk in yet, but I know I am officially done with the full-time job for the rest of my life. I am 48, soon to be 49 and my spouse is 47. I started my career at age 25 and my wife at 23. We both put in roughly twenty-three years each in our jobs. We had decent paying jobs during our career but neither of us really enjoyed what we did. Our average annual salary was about 80K (combined 160K). We were not adopting a complete FIRE lifestyle for most of our careers however. We did manage to travel and had some fun before we had our kids. We always maxed our 401K and contributed to ROTH whenever we could. We also religiously contributed to HSA account and paid all the healthcare costs out of pocket. We kind of got lucky with 529 as we started contributing quite a bit starting 2010 when market was starting to recover after 2008 crash. More than half of the 529 balance today actually came from the investment returns! We also paid our mortgage in about ten years then spent decent amount sending kids to private school through K-3, which we believe was a good decision.

Here is what our finances look like…

401K/ROTH: 2.3MM (including 300K in ROTH)

Home: 300K paid off, Upper Midwest, MCOL

Health Savings Account: 160K

College Savings (529): 310K (2 kids age 7 & 10)

FIRE Funds: 600K (to last \~11 years)

Yearly expenses: 55k (Basic expenses: 35K, Travel and entertainment: 20K)

We are planning to spend down 600K that has been allocated as “Fire Funds” until we turn 59.5 at which time, we plan on dipping into our 401K funds. I am investing the FIRE funds in diversified closed-end funds and dividend paying ETFs. As long as the portfolio returns three to four percent in average, it should last well over 11 years. If there is a major correction or any adverse event, I can always take a couple of months of consulting gig to make up for it.

We plan on traveling with kids in summer and winter breaks. We also do lots of hiking, camping, and outdoor activities which should be lots of fun knowing you don’t have to return to office on Monday. I plan on doing a few ½ marathons and 10K every year. We will spend some time volunteering at school and charities.

Had we known anything about FIRE and power of compounding, we could have probably FIREed a decade earlier. But we still don’t have any regrets. We had some good years traveling etc so it was all worth it. I definitely learned a lot from this board and more than anything you guys inspired me to call it a quit and spend some of my remaining “youth” with my kids and family. Thank you and feel free to comment or critique my plans. Happy Friday!!","self","https://redd.it/lnvadj"

My wife and I make a combined 50k a year and have no children. Very low income compared to most that I see here. We have zero credit card debt, and no car payments. 

- We owe 106,000 on our home at a 3% interest rate. Our only debt other than our home is 15k in federal student loans from where I just finished college (finally). I’m trying to find a higher paying position but not having much luck at the moment, salary is currently 30k and I’ve been at my job 5 years total. 

- $1600 in my 401k and my wife’s has around $2000. I have maxed out contributions to mine now. 

- We live in KY and our state has pretty low pay overall, but fortunately we live in a low cost of living area. 

Other than maxing out our 401k contributions, staying away from credit card debt and car payments, are there any other steps we can take to progress towards being set up better later on? I’ve read about ROTH IRA’s, and I just opened an account with fidelity to start one. 

My grandparents raised me and they were on disability most of their lives. So I don’t have much guidance when it comes to finances. I have always saved most of my paycheck, wanting to avoid living like my grandparents did. But I want to do even better somehow.

I think I need the following things to model this, if you've thought about this can you let me know what your numbers you use.

1. **Investment returns**. *7.32%*. Vanguard VT returns since inception ([https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/vt](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/vt))
2. **Inflation**. *2.5%*. Estimated number based on history of where I might retire. ([https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GBR/united-kingdom/inflation-rate-cpi](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GBR/united-kingdom/inflation-rate-cpi), [https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/EUU/european-union/inflation-rate-cpi](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/EUU/european-union/inflation-rate-cpi))
3. **Volatility**. *8%*. So a standard deviation of 8% on the inflation adjusted returns. So 4.7% +/- 8%.
4. **Normal Distribution**. *Yes*. I know the distribution isn't perfectly normal, but for the lack of a better distribution I am happy to use it.
5. **Evasive Action**. *+/- 20%*. If my retirement fund is looking in bad shape, I plan to take some evasive action. When my fund is below the inflation adjusted amount I will reduce my withdraw rate by 20%. So if I start with a fund of 1,000, and after 5 years of inflation it should be 1,100, if the actual value is less than that I will reduce my withdraw rate until it recovers. Likewise, if it's more than 30% over this number I will increase my withdraw rate by 20%.
6. **Annuity**. *yes*. If I hit 80 I don't want any more risk or complexity, so plan to buy an annuity then. I plan to have the same amount of fund value, inflation adjusted as when I started.
7. **Withdraw frequency**. *3 months*. Every 3 months I plan to withdraw 3 months of cash. This is inflation adjusted.

I created a model with the above and ran a monte carlo simulation, I count a success if I make it 35 years and my fund is still worth the same as I started (inflation adjusted) and I haven't done more than 8 years worth of negative evasive actions.

Here are my results, they are somewhat worrying to me. Have I got a number wrong?

For as long as I can remember, my mind has been on 'saving' mode. Sometimes I forget that money can be spent, and that is not usually a healthy thing to happen. We should live in moderation and find a balance. But I know I am not the only one to sometimes lose it. I sometimes struggle between accepting the buying of 'stuff' as something acceptable - but I have fewer issues when eating out or taking an Uber Black instead of a normal one.  
I am on my way to FIRE. Currently 33 yo with a SR of 66% and a NW of ca. 600k. At this rate it may be possible before I turn 40, but I'm not trying to fix a date.

I am willing to enter full retirement a little bit later in life, and in modest accommodations, if it means I can take a lot of adventure breaks along the way (I have taken a 6 month break before and it was great). Trying to mentally separate my ""sabbatical"" savings from my full retirement savings is making my head hurt, though.  Needless to say I am saving as much as I can right now as I recently had a very nice bump in income.  I am 30 years old and have no debts.  I do have a monthly car payment at 0% interest. Here are some points of confusion for me:  


1. I am maxing out my IRA and 401K now and place the majority of my other savings into mutual funds managed by a commercial entity.    I don't really have different earmarks for my ""other long term saving"" vs. ""money to support me for my next adventure.""  Should I make these separate buckets?  Should I make another ""emergency fund"" bucket?  I've heard advice against making too many bins in your savings accounts.  
2. In years where I don't work much, should I always max out my IRA/401K if I make enough earned income to do so?  Should I do this seven if it means I reach into savings to cover other expenses?
3. I don't think home ownership actually has any financial advantages if my goal is to spend, say, 6-12 months traveling every 5 years.  Therefore I don't need to be planning a down payment in the middle of this. Maybe I'm wrong.","self","https://redd.it/log1ex"

I live in Bangladesh where a lot of people live in extreme poverty, earning less than USD 2.00 or less. 

Now all the personal finance and wealth building books that I have seen tend to be directed towards Westerners. They assume that there is a functioning stock market that keeps on growing over time. They assume there are social safety nets such as disability, health and unemployment insurance. There is also an assumption that there are few barriers to employment or starting a business and there are tons of opportunities. 

This is simply not true for people living in absolute poverty in developing countries. For instance here in Bangladesh the stock market regularly crashes. There are no social safety nets whether its disability or unemployment insurance or universal healthcare. Bangladesh ranks last in Ease of Doing Business and opportunities for income generation are few and far between. This situation is evermore tolling on people under the USD 2.0 poverty line. Lots of them can read English and are working in menial jobs but cannot have a budget as the books suggest because the expenses are often more than the income: so they can't really save and invest. If they do save, a problem often occurs that depletes their savings (since there are no safety nets they fall into the poverty trap). 

So my question is: Are there ANY books out there that targets people living in extreme poverty to get out of their situation and be financially independent? Or are they beyond help and such books targeting them are simply not possible?

I've been a big fan of the FIRE community for years, and so much of what people has shared here has impacted my way of thinking about retirement. I've always wanted to be able to contribute something back, and I realized today that I actually had something that other people might find useful. 

[FIRE Pre-Retirement Model](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AufQ0ADSXuhn9EGYoGNeI5VcJBFF?e=NO7rCm)

This model stemmed from the idea that there are so many resources out there to calculate post-FIRE glide paths, but not many that **calculate the growth of your income over time before retirement.** I've been on a relatively high career trajectory so far, and I wanted to see how long I could anticipate still working before I get to a point that I'd feel comfortable retiring. 

This model calculates your relative net worth at all of your ages - so you know what it would look like if you decide to retire at a certain age (in my case, 40) or what the impact of working another year or two would look like. This model is NOT intended to calculate anything post-retirement (there are excellent alternatives out there already, like this one:  [FIRECalc: A different kind of retirement calculator](https://www.firecalc.com/)). As a result, the model breaks down after you retire (because it doesn't account for withdrawal rate).

I've detailed my assumptions in the upper left of the model, and some are in the model construction as well. Most of them deal with asset allocation; I've based the changes in allocation on the the Schwab 2020 target retirement allocation. Blue numbers are the assumptions by and large (blue means they are typed in manually rather than automatically calculated). My other major assumptions include:

*Side note: I've been very lucky in my life and had many advantages and privileges based on my gender, socioeconomic status, race, education, and just about everything else you can think of. I fully realize this, and strongly believe it is all of our responsibilities to help uplift those of us who aren't as privileged and level the playing field for future generations.*  

**Current net worth** \- this is calculated from my net worth on Jan 3 of 2021. Input yours here.

**House price & purchase date** \- I'm assuming a 500k house purchase in 3 years from today. Doesn't affect much of the model except the value of RE assets vs non-RE assets at retirement.. You can adjust row 33 and 34 to change this - you want to assign the down payment based on the date of the purchase, and they you want to mechanically change the year that you start building home equity.

**Avg. salary (mid year) & growth rate assumptions** \- I'm assuming a salary of 160k today that grows at 5% YOY at a real rate. This number came from (1) my current salary and (2) expectations of growth in my salary. For context: I'm a management consultant at one of the MBB consulting firms, and expect to remain in management roles/finance over my career. Based on my experience, growth to \~300k by age 40 might be slightly conservative.

**Savings rate -** I've kept a \~60% savings rate over the last 3 years of my career, so I've just assumed this will be consistent until I have kids, where it will drop to 30%. Is likely understated since as my salary grows, my expenses won't grow as proportionately. I've kept it simple though and just assumed that they will. 

**Retirement date** \- I assumed retirement at 40. You need to type in RETIRE in row 19 to change the date

There are some major assumptions that I haven't built out but can keep in the back of my head. A big one is marriage and adding a partner's salary to mine. I've left this off because of unpredictability, but there is a large amount of potential upside behind having 2x salaries (as I'm sure everybody here knows). Another is everything that goes into the savings rate calculation - the scope of this calc is very bespoke to the individual but so I just used historicals as a basis and picked the switch to 30% on an educated guess. 

Anybody can use this model effectively - they just need to download the model and change the assumptions as detailed above. I share in hopes that somebody else will find this useful! I'd also love to start a dialogue about other peoples' experiences and pressure test some of the assumptions I've used.","self","https://redd.it/lp8z32"

The numbers for foreign equities are a touch better.

When I run my FIRE calculations, I tend to run the numbers assuming an average annual real return of 4% (a worst case scenario) for the next 35 years and then assuming an average annual real return of 7% (best case scenario).

Psychogically, I feel good when the numbers work assuming a 5% average annual real return before retirement and a 3.5% SWR in retirement, but every once and a while the doubt creeps in and I start running calculations using an absurdly low 3.5% annual real return figure and a 3% SWR.

I then wonder, if I'm going to go conservative with my numbers, why not go *even more* conservative. I run my calculations with even lower expected returns and an even lower SWR. The natural result, of course, is briefly feeling like I'll never reach FIRE and that this is all pointless.

At what point are you being too conservative with your expected annual returns and SWR? What figures do you use? Is it a range? What are your most conservative figures? How do you control your urge to prepare for anything? I'm worried that as my net worth grows, I'll just keep setting a new milestone networth, using more and more conservative projected returns, and I'll never retire.

Now for this year's expenses.  First the charts from Mint:

Main Takeaways, last year I estimated that $22,700 was a reasonable real-world number for my annual expenses.   I ended up spending $28,600 last year.   About $4000 of that was some shopping splurging in January of this year for a new TV and computer stuff, because my financial situation was looking pretty good and I could spare the expense.   Otherwise I was right on target with my estimations.

For Healthcare, I did not take any ACA subsidies up front, and actually decided I'd rather do a larger Roth Conversion Ladder ($20,000) and convert some long term capital gains over to cash, thereby blowing up my AGI.  In order to get a subsidy I'd need an MAGI of under like $35,000, which just wasn't going to work for me.

**Investments:**

I'll include my numbers at retirement, at 1 year, and as of today.  I guess I'll start a table.

Vanguard Investments: 

Type|Retirement Day|1 Year|2 Years
:--|:--|:--|:--
Traditional IRA|$299,000|$348,000|$380,170
Roth IRA|$14,500|$18,150|$70,236
Brokerage|$18,400|$22,900|$37,108
Total Vanguard|$331,800|$389,100|$487,515
Other LTCG and Bitcoin|$145,000|$291,000|$1,315,000
HSA Investment|$6000|$7400|$8760
Cash|$20,000|$9000|$135,000

(Note on the Roth IRA, I don't think I had done my $20k conversion when I made the post last year.  So that was $18,150, +$20k for 2020 Ladder, +20k for 2021 Ladder already done.  So $58k, then ~$12k in gains makes the $70k.)

So, it's been a pretty good year.   Even with me losing about $60,000 with a bad GME play.  Still holding that loser though, diamond hands and all that.

With the Bitcoin run this year I've implemented my ""rule"" again.   Every time the price goes up 20% I sell one off.   So far I've sold at $33k, $39.8k, $48.2k, and then yesterday at $57.8k.   This is going to mean a pretty big tax bill this year, but I want to ""realize some gains"" and get that money out into something a bit more stable.

I'm doing a Roth Conversion Ladder of $20,000 to fill up the standard deduction and 10% tax level.  All of the tIRA and Roth IRA are 100% VTSAX (1 year returns of about 20%).  My Brokerage is $28k VTSAX and $9k (ow, it was $69k) of GME.

**The Living Part**

Not much of an update, just doing my thing.  TV, video games, reading, doing puzzles.  The weekly D&D game with my buddy and his wife (and his 18 month old baby) is a big highlight.  Quarantine sucks, I've only seen my other friends twice this past year.  Once was helping a buddy move house, and the other was a (carefully social distanced and completely outdoors) winter day-trip to the cabin to do some wood chopping.

If you want to read more of that live stuff, look at last year's post: it's all the same.

**I went back to work!**

Oh yeah, I did go back to work last year.  Well, kinda.  I had signed up to work the 2020 census back in December of 2019.  Thought it would be a fun thing to get me out of the house in the Spring.  Well, then 2020 happened and census got pushed out.  I got the call in June.  I did the week of training (all paid), and then worked the first day.  It really sucked.  First it was hot as balls, and also no one was answering the door.  Of the 35 cases I worked I talked to 5 humans and completed 2 surveys.  The second day was even worse, and after an hour of walking that day's route I just walked home, texted my field supervisor, and quit.   I ended up making a total of $575 for the like 20+ hours of training and then 3 hours of walking around before I quit.

I've found that I **really** don't like being told when and where to be someplace, and what to do.   Maybe if it wasn't in the middle of June and in a pandemic I might have had a bit more fun.  But it wasn't fun, so why would I subject myself to something I don't want to do.   That's kind of the best part about financial independance.  I don't let people make me do things I don't want to do.  ::shrug::   For this reason I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to a 9-5 job.  

That's it.  I guess I'll repeat the TL:DR from last time:  39, FIREd, Money's looking right, Life is feeling right, everything is fine","self","https://redd.it/lppel7"

I recently got engaged and have thus had cause to think about this. My SO and I are already established in our careers and split things down the middle typically. While I do believe I'll lose wages due to time off when we have children, the law seems to account for that pretty well so I'm not worried about including that. 

What worries me is the fact that he is not particularly FI minded, so his retirement accounts are wimpy compared to what mine will be as time passes. We save roughly the same amount and he makes ~20k more than I do right now, a gap that is only expected to get bigger as he is an early career electrical engineer who will get significantly better raises as he progresses in his career. He spends more, but he has more. He's just one of those people to have 30k sitting in his checking account doing nothing and he hasn't been too interested in hearing about the magics of tax advantaged space or compounding interest. I'm not particularly worried about that since we make a lot of money and I know I'll handle mine to my own standards.

Long story short, I don't want to get to a point where we're 10 years down the road seeing a divorce coming up (I doubt it but who goes into marriage thinking they'll need divorce?) and knowing my efforts to save 24.5k a year are on the chopping block. We're in a community property state. I don't want half of my retirement savings to be considered his when he has even more opportunity to fund his than I do but spends the money differently. I don't want to be penalized for being the responsible saver in our relationship.

I'm not sure how to raise this concern to him. I was thinking of maybe just showing him the numbers, like making charts and pointing out how much I would stand to lose vs him to make him understand it's not meant to insult him but rather protect me in an area where the law leaves me vulnerable to unfair treatment. I know many people here didn't start off with an FI-minded spouse and say it was something they grew into later, so if anybody else has any tips or advice, I would certainly love to hear it.

**Since I see a lot of replies thinking we have big disagreements about finances, Editing to add**: I don't spend as much as him but don't have a problem with his spending. I don't think it's irresponsible and he's got more than enough to cover it. And we do agree on the necessity of savings, just not on where it should be saved. He prefers post tax accounts, which means if he was to have some sudden change of personality and spend through all of his money, he could do so easily. Meanwhile I can't really touch my pre tax accounts which is where I put 24.5k a year, the majority of my savings. He could burn through his money and come for mine as community property in a divorce. That's my worry.","self","https://redd.it/lprmd2"

I slowly dialed down my involvement in the sub (as a moderator, and reader) over time. Turns out there's only so much tuning and fiddling you can do with hands-off investment. Yesterday I removed my mod access because we have a pretty awesome team of active mods in place right now.

July 2018 I posted that we had made our last conservative milestone, and there were no more (FI) goals left. I won't re-cover some of the points I made in this last post. Summary is that I was a manager of software teams (up to Director level) at a FAANG company, which enabled a pretty high savings rate:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8vjoob/made\_it\_last\_conservative\_fi\_milestone\_no\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8vjoob/made_it_last_conservative_fi_milestone_no_more/)

Since I have temporarily re-engaged with the sub , I thought it might be worth sharing a few things I've observed and/or learned over the last 2.5 years.

First - an updated networth graph - [https://imgur.com/a/tznzIcD](https://imgur.com/a/tznzIcD)

**Random observations, updates, and other bullet points!**

1. *Privilege*. Before anyone gets offended with us being wealthy, I'll repeat that we're well aware that we got lucky to get into the right industry, lucky to be born in the USA, etc. Lots of luck in life :)
2. *Frugality & Covid.* In my last update, I mentioned how our family is pretty frugal. Covid certainly didn't change that. We already avoided restaurants, our main entertainment has been (and continues to be) hiking, etc. So in my opinion, frugality really prepared us well for a pandemic. So that's an argument for frugality I wouldn't have guessed two years ago - preparation for global catastrophe.
3. *Work Update.* When I posted, I said I'd be taking time off work, and we didn't know what we'd be doing with our jobs. My wife ended up quitting hers, and I took a \~9 month sabbatical. The time off work was fantastic and involved a lot of travel and other fun things (thankfully we picked 2019, not 2020).
4. *Purpose in life / benefit of FI* \- Due to not actually needing more money (see the networth graph above), after my leave I was able to be very flexible on the type of work I was willing to do. I ended up taking a job making \~1/3 of what I was making before my leave working for a non-profit. Always wanted to do something meaningful at work, and FI enables it.
5. *Acceleration of networth* growth - The significantly lower pay is invisible on our networth graph, because of the crazy markets, and the fact that our networth is high. As everyone always says, the first million comes slowly, and each milestone after that comes more quickly. We have months where we gain (or lose) many multiples of my income.
6. *Doors open through FI* \- Being FI and having excessive saving opens up random doors. It's having a valuable tool in your toolbox which isn't only used for your personal expenses. We were able to help one of our family members with quick financing to buy a house (temporarily solving a banks moving slow problem for them). We were able to invest in a semi speculative real estate investment with a friend. All around I find we're able to have more open minds about opportunities when we have a good amount of cash sitting around.
7. *Careers driven people* \- In my experience, moving up in your career in a large company means that you spend some amount of mental energy on optimizing your career, comparing yourself to your peers (for good old competitive motivation), watching your compensation closely, etc. Early on to my leave, I observed previous peers moving their careers forward (getting promotions) and felt a sense of missing out. But over time as I took my leave and changed my career path, I found myself less emotionally connected to titles and compensation, and that's decreased the negative feelings. Which is a relief, because I don't like the idea of feeling jealous of something I don't need :)
8. *It's hard to walk away at the peak of your career.* I continue to play with the idea of going to make more money. I am sometimes tempted by people reaching out for neat opportunities, recruiters for hot tech companies, etc. A short two years of work could move our retirement from ""very safe"" at our current spending levels, to ""very safe"" at extravagant spending. Or we could become a huge safety net for our kids someday, or we could contribute millions to charity, etc. I think it's a core aspect of FIRE, that leaving work quite likely comes at the peak of your career. I've invested in myself and my reputation, and it's really hard to not take full advantage of it. (I have plenty of plans to not be bored and do cool things which might make money, but it's not the same as making 7 figures).
9. *Spending time with kids and family is priceless.* My kids spend far more time with me than most parents. Particularly when I was on leave, but even now that I have a very flexible schedule (and it's not nearly as demanding as a high tech job). I can have breakfast with them, hang out at dinner, never need late night emergency work, have spent weeks / months traveling, etc. By far the best thing FI gave me was time with my kids, since they'll never be this young again.

Anyway, I have always enjoyed learning about those who have made it to the finish line of FIRE, and thought it would be worth sharing. I'm happy to answer any general questions people might have.","self","https://redd.it/lpx6t5"

This is partially a success post, since I just hit $200k and wanted to celebrate, but also I wanted to offer a breakdown of what my journey has looked like so far, while undergoing cancer treatment in the US as a young person. Let me tell you, it's been a ride.

Here's the TL;DR for all y'all who don't want to read: 24F engineer discovers FIRE, saves for a few years, goes back to grad school, gets cancer, gets dream job, buys a house and adopts a dog. 29F today.

So right off the bat I'm going to acknowledge my privilege. I was raised by frugal parents in a lower-middle class background so I always had an appreciation of finances, and had help paying for my undergrad education. I graduated without a crushing amount of debt ($22k) and went into a lucrative field (engineering). Not all are as lucky as I have been.

Ready? Let's blast off.

&#x200B;

**Year 1:** Age: 22 NW: -$20,000 Salary: $0 -> $63,000  
Notes: Graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering in the spring and got a job offer in the defense industry on the other side of the country in the fall. I like space ships, not missile, but hey, I needed a job. Packed my bags and drove 2000 miles away. As soon as I got my first paycheck I started aggressively paying off my student loans.

**Year 2:** Age: 23 NW: $6,000 Salary: $65,000  
Notes: Was about halfway through my student loans, got myself some fancy new toys, but wasn't loving my career. Still sort of just coasting and enjoying having disposable income for the first time in my life.

**Year 3:** Age: 24 NW: $34,000 Salary: $68,000 -> $82,000  
Notes: I paid off my student loans! ...Now what? I suddenly had a surplus of cash and didn't know what to do with it. So I started to google and read a bunch about investing, and that's when I encountered **FIRE**. Finally I had a plan. Even though I didn't love my job, I could at least work toward the goal of investing and retiring early. Hell, I was already living frugally. Almost immediately after that I was headhunted by a competing company and quickly jumped ship. (Spoilers: I wouldn't enjoy the new job any more than the previous one. In fact, it solidified my resolve to switch career paths, FIRE be damned.)

**Year 4:** Age: 25 NW: $74,000 Salary: $82,000 -> $0  
Notes: After less than a year in the new job I was already ready to leave. I'd spent the last year aggressively saving before I applied to graduate school in a field tangentially related to my own (astrophysics) which makes less moolah, but would bring me a lot more happiness. I got in! The first year of graduate school was super fun. I took on some debt, as I applied too late to be considered for a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GSA) position that first semester, but hey, I was desperate to get out of my soul crushing career. I had enough money to pay for living expenses previously saved from my engineering jobs, so I just enjoyed college that first year, applied to be a GSA the following year, and applied to lots of internships for the next summer.

**Year 5:** Age: 26 NW: $82,000 Salary: $20,000  
Notes: And I got an internship at NASA! It was my dream internship. It was also during that internship I noticed a bump in my neck. That summer I went to three different doctors who all assured me, ""You're young, it's probably nothing."" I was young, but it wasn't nothing. When I returned to school that fall I went to my uni's crappy medical clinic, and the nurse there actually had the humility to admit she didn't know what the bump was. Instead of brushing me off, she referred me to a head and neck specialist. That nurse saved my life, because 2 months later I was diagnosed with cancer. That's a big *oof* in your 20's, in the middle of graduate school with hardly any income or health insurance. Oh yeah, and then I got the call to come interview for my dream job on the Artemis program two days later. Talk about a roller coaster.  
I skipped my finals that winter to have surgery. I recovered over winter break. The doctors told me I should take the next semester of school off, but I'm a bit stubborn. I had my thesis coming up, and I got an offer for aforementioned dream job. Hell no I wasn't going to quit now.

**Year 6:** Age: 27 NW: $67,000 Salary: $15,000 -> $78,000  
Notes: In January I took my missed finals. That semester I took the last two classes needed to get my master's, continued to teach and grade as a GSA, finished my thesis, and underwent radiation treatment over spring break. The bills started rolling in right around when I was graduating, but at least I had a job lined up. All told, I probably paid $10k out of pocket that first year (but let me tell you, that HSA I opened years earlier after reading about it on FIRE blogs saved my butt). Once I started my 9-5 I bought the best health insurance plan they offered. My parents also helped to pay about $5k of my medical bills. I know, they're amazing. I love them.

**Year 7:** Age: 28 NW: 105,000 Salary: $81,000  
Notes: You may have noticed that my new salary, despite me now having a master's degree and more years of experience, is actually less than my salary before I went back to grad school lol. I had expected that. That's what you pay for happiness. After getting back into my career, I was able to start aggressively saving again... which is great, because 9 months into the new job I was diagnosed with Cancer: Round 2. Fight! (And getting scheduled for surgery in the middle of a pandemic is it's own fun bucket of balls, let me tell you.) Luckily this time I recovered much faster, and paid only $2,500 out of pocket due to the very fancy health insurance I mentioned before.

**Year 8:** Age 29 NW: $200,000 Salary: $85,000  
Notes: And because I guess I was feeling giddy after the cancer thing, I decided to buy a house! Just three months ago. So part of the jump in my NW is due to home equity, but not much. This was just a really good year for my investments, and I saved over 50% of my income. Oh, and I also got a puppy, because I've always wanted one but I wanted to wait until I had a yard, first. He's 4 months old now and is the best thing to ever exist in the history of humanity. Which brings us to... today.

&#x200B;

The blood work is looking good, so if I'm lucky all the cancer stuff is behind me. The frequent labs and ultrasounds are still a bit of a drain on my finances, and I'll be on daily medication the rest of my life as a result, but I'm lucky to be in a good paying field that can support my medical needs.

**SUMMARY**  
Average Income since undergrad: \~58k  
Liquid Assets: $20k  
Retirement Accounts: $150k  
Home Value: $450k  
Mortgage: $410k  
Grad Loans: $10k  
\-------------------------  
Net Worth: $200k

At the rate of current expenses and savings, I think I can hit my FIRE number in 10 years, around when I hit 40. This isn't accounting for things like kids (I'm a gay woman, so if anything I'd adopt), marriage (a boosted combined income would be excellent), extra roommate income (I've got another room in this house I'm not yet renting, because I'm just enjoying alone time with my pup), or a side hustle. However, a side hustle is likely in my future, because while all this was going on, I was also working on my hobby, which is writing fiction. I don't self publish, but I've been querying in traditional publishing circles for a few years now, and it's looking like a book deal might be in my not so distant future. If my writing career does take off, I think I could go to part-time work in about 5 years. Writing is something I really love, and it's been an amazing stress reliever and outlet for everything I've gone through, so if the numbers looked good enough I would even consider switching to that career full time. But that's still just one of many possible tomorrows.

Things I'd do differently?

Not much. I guess if I had the magical ability to predict my cancer I wouldn't have chosen to do grad school at the same time, lol. And grad school itself basically lost me 2 year's worth of early savings and  compound interest. But I'd do it all again. I loved the program and the people I met there. I've loved working at my new job. I mean, we're sending people to the flippin' Moon, guys! How sweet is that? I didn't enjoy my first 3 years in the defense industry, but it was needed to gain valuable work experience and skills and pay off my undergrad loans. Oh yeah, and I still have $10k on my grad school loans, but since there's no accruing interest or payments due right now as a result of the pandemic (and Biden may or may not forgive student loans) I'm holding off on paying those down in order to invest and replenish my liquid assets after pouring a bunch into the house closing costs.

So, yeah. That's it, guys. It's been a ride. Dunno if you all got anything out of this, but it's been fun to share. I guess if I had any parting words of wisdom, it's to not sacrifice your today for your tomorrow. Running face-first into cancer was a pretty big wake up call for me: all that saving and FIRE planning I'd been doing, and I might die before I would mean anything? I'm not saying to go out and blow all your cash on cars and casinos. But hey, go for that lower paying career that'll make you happier. Finally get that dog you promised yourself you'd have when you were 12. Make time for your favorite hobbies today.

EDIT: Obligatory ""Wow, this blew up!"" I just want to answer some additional questions here so you don't have to go digging.

**What kind of cancer is it?** Thyroid cancer, which had done a lot of spreading. I got it worse than your typical thyroid cancer case, but thyroid cancer is still waaaay more treatable than most other types of cancer, so I feel both lucky, and optimistic about beating it.

**Where did you live during this?** Florida, Alabama, Arizona, and Colorado. The first three were low cost of living and I was able to save a bunch. Denver has been much higher COL, so it's been tougher to save.

**A $450k mortgage seems like a lot.** Well first off, that's not a question. And second, yeah, I know lol. But I have a very low interest rate, and the price is actually on the low end (without being a dump) for the city I currently live in. In fact, the mortgage is only about $500 more than I was paying for rent on my 1 bedroom apartment. And if I wanted to rent out the extra room, I'd actually be saving money! Since I'm settled with a job I intend to stay with in a city I intend to stay in, financially it just made more sense.","self","https://redd.it/lq8soo"

The IRA advice on these financial threads is really overwhelming. Everyone says dump as much as you can into it, as early as you can, but I can't contribute as it currently stands, and I'm not sure how important changing that is.

I live overseas and pay taxes in the country I work in, which gives me foreign residency and Foreign Income Exclusion.

However, it comes with the catch of having no earned income as far as the IRS is concerned.

The Foreign Tax credit is another option but that requires giving up my foreign income exclusion for at least the next five years.

It seems to me, that the most economical situation would be to turn my rentals into an L.L.C. and pay myself a minimal salary. But that seems like a lot of running around and complications given my location and Covid issues.

Is it really that big of a difference if the $18,000 I'd have invested for 2020, 2021, and 2022 goes into a regular brokerage account instead of a tax advantaged account?

Is maxing out your IRA important enough that someone thinking about their future/trying to FIRE should do everything they can to make it happen? Or can you make do with a brokerage account for a year or two without doing too much damage?","self","https://redd.it/lqen6z"

The problem with many LCOL places is that they are low cost because they have some really shitty attributes.

I live in a LCOL city in the South. I don’t particular like to live here, but the job pays reasonably well, at least for a LCOL area. As I begin to think about retirement, I know this isn’t where I *want* to be. Partly due to ultra conservative politics, and partly due to very hot summers. There are many, many, places that I like much better. 

Because I’m used to where I live, I get sticker shock everywhere that I look at home prices in more attractive locations (e.g. mountains, beaches, coasts). 

If you’ve made a transition from a LCOL nowheresville to a M/HCOL region, how did it go? Financially it makes little to no sense to retire in a more expensive place. A huge portion of your life savings would go straight into the purchase price of a home, and quite possibly one that is not as nice as the one that you were previously living in.

We will be 60 years old, and our plan re: health insurance is to move from work-based insurance to ACA by signing up during Open Enrollment, and starting our ACA coverage on Jan 1 2023 .  Then in 5 years we will sign up for Medicare once we are eligible.  

Our taxable income in 2023 will come solely from withdrawing from 401K.  It is my understanding that when signing up for ACA, we may be asked to [verify our expected income](https://www.healthcare.gov/verify-information/).  However, my current salary is more than double our yearly expenses, with the rest of it going into savings and paying off the last of our home mortgage.    

How can we prove to the ACA folks that I will no longer be employed, and that we intend to reduce our income?  Our planned AGI for 2023 puts us solidly into subsidy range at roughly 300% poverty level, but our income in 2022 while I'm still working will put us *way* outside any subsidy if we are obligated to use that as projected income.  

A follow-on question -- if I decide to retire a few months early in, say, September 2022, and use COBRA till the end of the year, and *then* start ACA on Jan 1 2023, does that change anything with regard to proving intent to the ACA people?  In this scenario we could go ahead and start drawing from 401K in September as well, but I have no idea if that would help prove intent or help us demonstrate expected income.

I cannot seem to find this question specifically: if a person were contributing to an IRA while in the US, then moved abroad for retirement, exclusively *withdrawing* from the plan while outside the US, which is preferable: Roth or Traditional IRA?

If a person were to retire to a country with no capital gains tax such as Belgium, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Singapore, Monaco, Slovakia, Slovenia, etc, the answer seems simple: Roth IRA. You wouldn't pay taxes to the US because it's a Roth, and you wouldn't pay capital gains taxes in the country of tax residence.

Similarly, if a person were to retire to a country which recognizes the tax status of Roths, such as France or the UK, it seems a retiree could avoid taxes in retirement.

However, what if a person were to retire to a country which has significant capital gains taxes and also does not recognize US Roth IRAs? My reaction would be to contribute to a Traditional IRA while stateside, then pay capital gains tax to the country of tax residence in retirement, and claim the Foreign Tax Credit to the US. This would mean you effectively pay the greater of the two tax rates and avoid double taxation. However, my plan may be incorrect, as the US considers IRA withdrawals income, not capital gains. Can a person claim the Foreign Tax Credit when the country of tax residence considers a withdrawal capital gains, and the US considers the same withdrawal income?

Or, am I incorrect in my assumptions, and do most non-US countries, in fact, consider IRA withdrawals income, not capital gains?","self","https://redd.it/lrdpz3"

I believe I might be having an attitude problem, but the fact is... I don't really care about the work I do. I am working in a commercial assistant role but don't care about getting everything perfect. ""Maximizing entitlement"" and ""cost control"" are a few of the main buzzwords, but I genuinely don't care much about them. Sure, I still want to be employed and get the money for work, but I am not really interested in working harder trying to improve the profit, maximizing value, minimizing cost... As long as I get paid, as long as we as a branch can chug along (so I can continue to get paid and I could avoid getting asked any questions from the senior managers and the directors), I am not really bothered by the inefficiencies.

While I am not a Marxist and I believe in Capitalism, I just don't want to inconvenience myself and make myself work harder just some owner would be able to buy another mansion or another sports car. I wouldn't say I am jealous of them, but I just don't find them important enough to do more than just a minimum not to get fired.

Every week that passes I just tell myself that: ""cool. 6 more weeks left until my next Annual Leave"". Every month that passes and I get paid, I just do my monthly budgets and calculate that I will need 5 more years until I can FIRE and just go do my own thing.

Is my attitude of ""doing the minimum just not to get fired while counting days/weeks/months until the holiday/FIRE"" normal amongst the general working population, or is it just me just being a lazy POS?

This attitude has increased significantly after I have made a decision to seek to FIRE. Did something similar, thinking that ""all of this is temporary, so I don't feel like I have to prove anything to anybody"" occur to you as well?","self","https://redd.it/lrfn3s"

For instance, I had to sue my prior landlord because she stole my deposit and tried to charge me an additional $1000 for carpet that was ""burned and stained"" (her words on the initial walk through). I got my deposit back, and transunion removed the ""debt collection"" from my credit report, and I was then able to buy a house.

My question though is this: Is there a point where some of you have enough money that you know you won't need a loan where you just decided you weren't going to pay BS bills even if it lowered your credit score?

It seems like 30 years ago you could just tell the person to come back with something more reasonable or they weren't getting anything, and that seems to be a check and balance the world needs. I've paid every debt I've ever had in the past, but after all that when the ""debt collection"" was reported to transunion it dropped my credit score from 785 to 679. There wasn't a shred of legitimacy to that, and she was forced to pay me my deposit back as soon as we went to court. (Her lawyer had told her she was going to lose before she came there which was her response when the judge asked her to provide documentation for her claims. I'm embarrassed to admit how much going to small claims court stressed me out, and how many years of my life were likely shaved off by being furious and constantly wondering if I was going to get railroaded no matter what. Transunion had sided with my landlord. However, after the small claims court decision and a very threatening letter they removed it.)

Specifically, I'm thinking about outrageous medical bills (american here) and other things like that. Thoughts?

Edit: Just to be clear, I am specifically wondering about this from a financial independence standpoint. Normal people wouldn't have the ability to never need to take out a loan, and have to worry about credit scores, and a lot of the other things that I have a feeling have driven many of us to this path. A big motivation for me is to leave the US, the capitalist rat race, and the riskiness of a country where getting cancer means bankruptcy behind and take my money and my skill set to a country that values human dignity in the way I do. I'm not a Marxist by any standpoint and I'll fully acknowledge the benefits of a market based economy, but in my opinion there are certain sectors that should be off limits to the profiteers.","self","https://redd.it/lrqk3c"

Spouse and I still take vacations and enjoy the moment, but I find myself ""spinning my wheels"" planning or calculating when we can quit working.

Will give a brief summary of where I""m at in the FIRE journey in case it's relevant.  35 years old, spouse (31) and I have been good saving in the past but didn't get serious about FIRE as early as I wished.  140kish  household annual salary (bonus can drive it higher), about 65% savings rate vs take home, 200k NW with about 140k liquid primarily in tax shelters.  Happy to provide details if requested but don't think its pertinent here.

Most of our plan is set on autopilot as our investment contributions are automatic via employer or auto-deposit.  We are projecting a retirement in 10 to 13 years dependent on market returns and what will be a decision of ""how much do I dislike working vs how much luxury spending do I want"" that won't be made until closer to the retirement date.  We are mostly on autopilot, aiming for a retirement nest egg of $1.8m-$2.25m that we should hit when I'm 45 to 50 if I don't see significant promotions.  Jobs aren't extremely stressful compared to what we have worked, and we intentionally plan time away from work relatively well (4 to 5 weeks vacation for each of us annually which is pretty good in the US), though we have a 40 minute commute each way that drains some of our time.

With things mostly in order and just playing to the waiting game, I still find myself spending an inordinate amount of time building out our post-retirement plans (some vacation planning which is helpful) and re-re-re-reviewing our income projections (not helpful).  Have you found  yourself in the same spot, and how did you get out of this trap?  I'm happy to plan for the future but I feel like looking forward 10 years all the time with no further planning needed isn't a healthy mindset...","self","https://redd.it/lryf6w"

I do tend to job hop for higher income and experiences. In the initial interview when they ask you ""where do you see yourself in 10 years"" I obviously keep quiet and tell management what they want to hear. However as you're more comfortable around your team and manager, and closer to FIRE'ing I'm wondering if there's any drawbacks to disclosing your plan a year or two before you hit ""the number""? eg. to have the company consider an adjusted work schedule for your future.

Or in the case of when you leave the company, would it be acceptable to disclose your plan so that they know in the future you're open to consulting part time? Part of being an independent contractor is that you have to find your own work and word of mouth from people who have worked with you in the past goes a long way. But I also wouldn't want to be taking on work that's actually a full time commitment. 

The above also of course assumes your own judgement of the people around you, if they're the jealous type, and if you're a high enough performer to make those suggestions.

I have two daughters 8 & 5 and a son who is 1. We just hit 1 mil invested net worth this year with no debt and very comfortable expenses of around $70k not including taxes.


We currently save & invest roughly 2x our expenses every year. By conservative math half of typical returns for the next 15 years we will be we more than safe to retire by 50 with well over 35x expenses saved not including my pension or our SSA benefits. (These by themselves would cover nearly our entire expenses starting at 62) 

Neither one of us hate our Jobs, my wife's is a more high pay high stress style job than mine but it's also one she can do from her home office. But, neither one of us ""loves"" our job. We prescribe to the idea you work to live not live to work. 

All that was just some background to let everyone know we will be ""able"" to retire at 50 very comfortably and probably could retire at 45 with out issues. 




The problem is that I keep running into is that in 10 years, our kids will be 18, 15, 11. And in 15 years our kids will be 23, 20 , and 16. 


Has anyone retired with teenagers that could give some advice?

My kids are great 0 problems life wonderful. I would retire now with them if I could.

But, once kids get into their highschool years they won't be little kids anymore that I could just pick up and spend months away on trips or would I imagine be thrilled having mom and dad home all the time.

Likewise they won't quite be old enough to just have them housesit when we go on some grand long trips.

Also, while we do talk financial stuff with our 8 year old how healthy is it for kids to see their parents retired before they even go to college?



Right now I am thinking of waiting until I am 52 and my youngest is 18 before retirement, but even then I am torn. I will have been working nearly a decade longer than I needed to and at the same time my son still will not have even started college. I know it is a first world problem. But I figured there have got to be some people in my situation here.


The other option would be to retire in my early 40's and get extra time with my kids as kids, but I certainly wouldn't have the retired on the beach life possible with working ±5 more years. Wife is not a fan of the risk of not having enough to help our kids later on in life if needed. 



What have the people here who have multiple kids done and what works and what doesn't?




Edit: just to add My dad retired pretty early even though it was before FIRE was a thing. He retired at 55 and it was great. It has been what started motivating me to want to retire early. 55 was the original goal then 50. 

Now it is looking like 45 would be possible and I just don't know if retiring too young would make this change from an inspiration like it was to me. To a possible detriment of my teenagers not seeing their parents working and expecting life just to be easy. And not understanding the hard work and savings that we have done for the past 13 years.



Edit part deux:
We are not the typical FIRE couple who are working ourselves to the bone burning the candle at both ends.  
My job is hard and sometimes physically demanding but it is usually enjoyable and a 15 min drive from my house.
My wife's job is not fun and high stress, but it is a work from home job that literally let's her work in her pajamas. Even pre-covid.","self","https://redd.it/lvemtb"

Right now wife and I have high income and only $30K annual expenses. We do not plan to have kids, and if we ever took a mortgage is would be on a small house in a LCOL area. We therefore expect annual expenses to stay well below $80K throughout our life. We are maxing our retirement accounts (401K and IRA) and investing an additional amount in index funds. We also have committed to donating, on average, more than we spend.

**Our basic tax strategy pre-FIRE: bundle donations and contribute to Traditional IRA over Roth**

From now on we are maxing our Traditional IRA rather than rolling over into a Roth IRA, so as to reduce taxes during our high earning years. We plan to bunch donations every 4-5 years and itemize, but will take standard deduction the rest of the time. Toward the end of our FIRE journey, if we enjoy our work enough to keep going, we may donate 60% of AGI to stay in a low tax bracket. 

**Our basic tax strategy after FIRE: stay below the $80K income to get 0% long term capital gains tax**

After hitting FIRE, we plan to tap into our non-retirement account investments as needed but will pay 0% on long term capital gains since our total income should be well below the $80K threshold. Some of that income may be from hobbies or limited contract work. By staying well under $80K we could benefit from ACA healthcare subsidies.

After we are ~62 and on Medicare, we may withdraw closer to $80K and use whatever is leftover after expenses to rebalance or donate. I ran the numbers and our RMD + SS after we are 72 shouldn’t be higher than 80K. 

With no capital gains tax, we wouldn’t normally benefit from a Roth IRA. We currently have ~$50K in Roth IRA, which we will save for later years. If we have a few expensive years later in life (e.g., high medical out of pocket, assisted living, etc) we can pull from our Roth (which should have grown 10x) without a tax burden.

At death, we plan to leave our estate to charity. We shouldn’t have over the 11M estate tax exemption limit since we will be donating to charity throughout our lives.


Now that I’ve written it all down, it seems more complex! But it’s simpler than a lot of the strategies that come into play if you need more than $80K a year. Thanks for any feedback.

Here is the conclusion:

To answer the question from the post title:

**It’s not crazy at all to keep 100% equities right until you retire!**

At least if you’re planning an early retirement with 1) high contribution rates and 2) some flexibility about your retirement date. The 100% equities throughout would certainly be defensible if you find yourself in the middle of a bear market a few years before retirement. Then just keep the 100% equities and ride the subsequent bull market until you retire!

Even if you apply some more risk aversion, you will certainly still start with a 100% equity allocation, but you’d likely walk that down over the last 5 or at least 2.5 years before retirement. Also quite intriguing is that the high initial equity weight is defensible even when considering that the S&P 500 is at or close to its all-time-high. 

So, for all of the folks out there who regularly make fun of me as the über-conservative retirement blogger and call me the Grinch of the FIRE movement, you all should take a positive and uplifting message away from today’s post: Before retirement, I certainly endorse a very gutsy and high-risk approach to investing. Only when you get close to retirement you want to take it down a notch and walk down the equity portion to well below 100%. And when retired you definitely want to lower the withdrawal rate when equities are expensive!

It is too easy to get caught up in what we see online and people posting huge balances or how much money they have made that it can entice us to try the ""get rich quick"" approach which should never be a goal. As someone who has lost a significant amount taking risky investments I am now 32 and starting over from scratch. I am fortunate that I own my own home (though no equity) and a decent paying job but in this situation I now feel like ""If only i didn't lose that money and had just left it in the market I would have XXXX, maybe I should try to just make that back and then follow the plan"" which is the dumbest approach ever. The reality is I will continue to lose as will most others and then have this same situation but now at age 40 or 50 with a lot less time to recover.

Back to the title of the post it doesn't matter what happened in the past or what you could have done or should have done and instead the best time to get it together and start making the right choices is right now. Over time we will also develop the habit of being financially responsible which helps limit future self destructive decisions which is key since you can undo a lot with just one year of dumb decisions.

For me I have taken the following actions that I would encourage others who might relate to this post to do the same. I closed any type of trading or margin account and moved my money completely into my company plan for retirement accounts, this way it is off my pay check each month and more difficult for me to close it or withdraw the money and I am limited to low cost index funds in that account. My other account is now through my bank, which has a boring website but psychologically better, and is a cash only account without ability to touch options in addition to no margin. Lastly, I accelerated my mortgage payments to rebuild equity in my home and force a certain level of limited spending on me.

The reality is with 10-20K a year in various savings you can be financially set by retirement and gambling for some incremental increase in networth won't improve that future at all. 

I wish i made these decisions at any point before today but now is the best time available to start. If you want to get rich, do an extra job, improve some skill or try a side business but do not use the market as a casino as you will lose eventually with that approach and also develop bad habits that could destroy your finances later in life.

Hope this didn't come off too much like a rant and maybe someone will read this and relate enough to start making the right decisions now instead of later.","self","https://redd.it/lww2u2"

There seems to be a lot of aversion to any risk. Investing in an index fund has its own risk.  We should talk about measured risk. 

Investing in a 200k into a business or real estate property is risky. But that shouldn’t be shunned as a way to reach because it has it’s risks. The same could be said about single stocks. You can choose ones with high upside yet low downside risk. My point is that we as a community quickly suggest that anything except a VTSAX heavy profile is too risky and I think that oversimplified it.

We own our home (very little equity so far), both work full time, have two young children, own our two vehicles outright, and started a side business last year that took a $35K investment to get going.  Our net worth sits at about $360K.  Assets include $330K in retirement accounts, conservative home value of $290K, and about $22K cash we keep on hand.  Liabilities are $270K mortgage balance, and $12K left on the business loan.  Total average savings rate is about 20%.

We were getting discouraged seeing how all of our peers around our age seem to have bigger, more extravagant houses, multiple 'toys' (offroad vehicles, camp trailers, snowmobiles, boats, etc.), take multiple vacations each year, and generally appear to be kicking ass at life.  We often found ourselves in discussions about how you only live once, and that our friend with a bar in the basement sure has a nice house (our house is great too, but not extravagant if that makes sense.)

This post is a reminder that you're doing great and to not compare yourself to your peers.  95% of our peers referenced above, it turns out, have net worth in the negative tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Some of our closer friends found out about our modest wealth through discussions on saving for retirement, and they have started asking us for advice.  We became more aware of their situations as a result; between student loans, credit card debt, car loans, mortgage debt, and loans for all the toys they have, our peers average between negative $200,000 and negative $300,000 net worth.  It turns out, most of them are pretty envious of our relatively good financial position.  Their debt payments typically account for more than half of their family income each month while they put away very little for retirement.

Don't be too hard on yourself!  The sacrifices you are making now will pay off soon enough.  Remind  yourself that the big spenders you're surrounded by typically wish they had a fraction of your savings and discipline.  You're doing great!

As one possible outcome, I was thinking about the situation where we age and need long term care (hopefully many years down the road!).  The long term care facilities are [super expensive](https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/basics/info-2017/continuing-care-retirement-communities.html)(think of 300-500k entry fee + monthly care cost).  Ideally, I'd want to put my assets in to a medicaid shielded trust and use medicaid so I can pass on the wealth.  But 401k and IRA complicates things a bit.  Depending on the state, all your assets including retirement accounts need to be near zero to get medicaid.  What do people do in situations like this?  How would you plan for this scenario?

For more info on per-state treatment of 401K + IRA when it comes to getting medicaid help, see this page -  [https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-401k-ira/](https://www.medicaidplanningassistance.org/medicaid-eligibility-401k-ira/)  Note that some states exempt 401K + IRA when computing medicaid elgibility.

Last year my expenses were split about 35% needs, 15% wants, 50% savings. No kids/house and no plans on either (spouse agrees) I discovered FIRE about 3 years ago but thanks to family being financially knowledgeable I have been investing since 21 when I entered the workforce

Something that is often talked about is how especially in the early years, the growth of your portfolio has more to do with contributions than how the market is doing. Because of this, it seems like the fastest way to ""jumpstart"" your FIRE journey is to save aggressively for many years early on and then once compounding starts to have more of an impact, back off some and let your money work for you. 

This is where my conundrum comes in. At what point do you start to back off? One year of aggressive savings early on can easily shave several years off of FIRE and early in life the future value of a dollar is incredible. This can often make it hard to justify buying things with a higher price tag such as trips, upgrading my computer (6 years old), etc. I have found in the short term this isn't a big deal, but over several years it starts to wear on you. I am not miserable, or anything, more just feel like I live in a bit of a groundhogs day, and considering how even a couple more years of this could shrink my fire date by 5+ years it can feel hard to justify lowering my savings rate by anything significant. 

Have any of you dealt with this? The one more year syndrome of a high savings rate early in your saving careers? How did you start to wean yourself off to something more ""reasonable"".","self","https://redd.it/lxlmui"

My SO and I have a handful of cities that we'd like to buy a second property in, but it would never be a rental property, just ours. Our lives and careers are busy where we are now, so it wouldn't make sense to buy anytime soon.

But I was wondering, what are the drawbacks to just annual or semi-annual rentals? Our house is going to be paid off well before FIRE, if we ever FIRE or just retire normally, so would it be economical to just skip town to town, spending a few months here and there, while always having a home base?

I'm just thinking of the opportunity cost of purchasing and upkeeping a property for when we FIRE, versus putting that money into the market, or hedging against us changing our minds about a city or that city not being retirement-friendly in the future.

We don't have kids, and reading from FIRE and /r/fatfire I see that for a lot of people lakehouse and beachhouses only really make sense when they are inter-generational: either something semi or fully inherited or something they are looking to pass down or have extended family use.","self","https://redd.it/lxsgnq"

Why my opinion matters: I work at a big TPA, and literally half of my time is spent fixing this specific type of operational failure. I am sharing this because I just told an employer they owe their employees $40k.

If your employer doesn’t deposit deferrals into your 401(k) plan as soon as administratively feasible (e.g 7 days) your employer likely owes you money.

There is a subset of the DOL called EBSA that takes this very seriously. If you call them, you will (eventually) get interest on money owed to you. dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/about-us/regional-offices

Furthermore, the IRS also watches this. They are focusing on the issue this year. This is unsurprising due to COVID, as I noticed a tripling of this issue last year. They are usually looking for bigger fish though.

# Comments About Timeliness of Deferrals

Legally speaking, employers have up to the 15th of the following month to deposit deferrals, but that is if it wasn't otherwise administratively feasible. I have *NEVER* seen the DOL allow this, because technology makes depositing payrolls so easy.

If you work for a large employer (e.g. 100+ employees), the money usually has to be deposited in fewer than 3 business days. These plans are required to be audited by an accountant each year. I have seen some accountants allow 0 days, I've seen some allow 5...I've never seen more than 5 days.

If you work for a small employer (e.g. <100 employees), the government allows a ""safe harbor"" of up to 7 business days.

# Comments About Timeliness of Match

**Example 1 - Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan**

If your plan document states that safe harbor match is delivered annually, the **safe harbor match** is considered timely as long as it is deposited by the end of the plan year (usually 12/31) following the year in which it occurred.

Date of paycheck: 03/05/2021

Plan year end: 12/31/2021

Due date: 12/31/2022

**Example 2 - Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan**

If your plan document states that safe harbor match is delivered each payroll, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or any period more frequent than annually, the safe harbor match is due by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the error occurred.

Date of paycheck: 03/05/2021

Due Date: 06/30/2021

**Example 3 - Traditional 401(k) Plan**

Usually, the due date is the same as example 1 regardless of the match frequency.

# FAQs

* How do I get this fixed?
   * Always review your plan documents. You should be able to retrieve a ""Summary Plan Description"" (SPD) from your employer. Read that thoroughly to know what you are entitled to as a participant of the plan.
   * Talk to your employer about [the DOL's self-correction program](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/401k-plan-fix-it-guide-you-have-not-timely-deposited-employee-elective-deferrals) if you believe they will actually do something about the issue.
   * Tell your employer to reach out to a 401(k) third-party administrator, because that is who will  (hopefully) know how to fix the issue.
   * Reach out to [EBSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/about-us/regional-offices) (part of the DOL) directly, and big GubMint will come knocking
* What if my employer didn't allow me to contribute money to me plan?
   * This is called a missed deferral opportunity, and I intend to write an article on the subject in the near future.
* What is a deferral?
   * Any money that comes out of your paycheck is a deferral.
* Do these rules apply to an HSA?
   * I'm not an expert on HSAs, but it appears that is the case.

I've been posting my family's net worth updates annually on this subreddit for many years (see [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/308xtv/on_track_to_re_by_50/), [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4a6oww/one_year_update/), [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5ynkqi/two_year_update/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/838e92/three_year_update/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b44qvp/four_year_update/), and [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fevzeg/five_year_update/) updates); I find sharing my plans and progress to be helpful for giving myself a heading check, and hope this community finds my inputs to be helpful.  Last year, my post happened right as the the apocalypse was kicking off, and our portfolio was suffering heavy losses.  Let's see how that turned out over the past year.

**Current ages: 35 and 34**. We have two kids who are now entering public school age.  We still have to pay for after school care, but in general our childcare costs have been trending down over the past couple of years.

**Combined pre-tax income**: About $206k (\~5.1% increase).  About a month after my last post, my wife took a 10% pay *cut* because of COVID.  It wasn't a huge deal because of our large savings rate (also not like there was much to spend money on during early lockdown anyways). We still made some budget cuts, and then her pay was restored about 6 months later, and we got raises on top of that - all of which is to say, our cash flow has increased dramatically lately.

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund: \~$80k (81.8% increase).  Big increase in cash over the past year, for a few reasons.  We did a cash out refi about a year ago to do a bunch of home repairs (furnace repair, backup generator, replacement windows, new water heaters, removing dead trees).  Because lockdown reduced our spending, we were able to accomplish all that and still grow cash, which made us more comfortable considering there seemed to be an actual apocalypse going on.  The next home upgrade we want to do is a new roof+solar project within the next year, which will bring our cash back down to normal.

Tax advantaged Retirement/HSA accounts: \~$721k (49% increase). So uh, that happened.  We're now maxing out both her 401k and my TSP, both Roth IRAs, and an HSA.  Nobody could have predicted that the pandemic stock market lows would have happened as early as they did, or that the stock recovery would have happened so fast.  I certainly didn't predict that - but I did continue to buy and hold index funds, as always, and was rewarded for it.

529 accounts: \~$46k (27.8% increase). We live in Florida, which has one of the few pre-paid tuition plans that actually make a lot of sense.  So we've been moving over 529 money into the prepaid plans.  Once those are fully paid off in a couple years, we'll go back to putting money into the 529s again (to pay for housing expenses, or if they want to go private or out of state or grad school).  Our goal has long been to cover about \~75% of the total in state public college expenses, but now it looks like we might get closer to 100% just because of good fortune.

Taxable investments: \~$20.5k (128% increase). This increased pretty dramatically because of efforts on two fronts.  First, since we've now maxed out tax shelters, I've set up a new payroll deduction to send money directly to the taxable brokerage, and will move most future raises towards that.  Second, since travel has been off the table for the past year, I've been running an Amex Gold + Platinum Schwab [churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/) setup for most of our spending over the past year, which has made us several thousand dollars going straight to a taxable brokerage account.

Vehicles: $31k KBB value of three cars (2% decrease). Same cars as last year, just depreciation. And not much of it this year, which weirds me out.  Maybe because they barely got any miles?  Maybe the used car market is being weird right now?  I dunno, I'm just reporting the numbers.

Home: Using Federal Reserve MSA home index, our home value is now \~$603k (4.5% increase), using Zillow estimate is currently $691k (5.8% increase).  We use a range to estimate our home's value.  It's kinda crazy to look back and realize the home appreciation over time; we got \*very\* lucky with being able to buy our house in 2012.

**Debts:**

Mortgage: $359k at 2.875% for 30 years (32% increase). We refinanced our mortgage, and used it to pay off our home equity loan, car loan, and to start building up cash.  The interest rate is so low here that we don't see much point to even trying to pay it off early, and will be focused on building up assets instead.

Home Equity Loan: $0 at 4.75% (100% decrease). Gone!

Car Loan: $0 at 3.1% (100% decrease). Gone!

**Net Worth Estimate:** $1.14M using MSA Home Index (\~34.8% increase), $1.23M using Zillow (\~33.4% increase). There it is.  We became millionaires right in the middle of the ""worst year ever.""  Without using crypto or Tesla or meme stonks.  Just boring old index funds,  mostly held in tax advantaged retirement accounts.

**Current plans going forward:** We hit a lot of goals over the past year.  It feels like we're approaching the end of the ""boring middle"", and are now racing to quickly build up significant assets and achieve financial independence.  Our goal is to be able to FIRE if we want to by \~2030 with \~$100k income.","self","https://redd.it/lz36f7"

Most of us are familiar with the Mega Backdoor Roth, where you can contribute up to $38,500 (2021, with no employer matching) to an after-tax 401k then do an in service distribution to your Roth IRA. The downside is you have to have a provider that allows not only after-tax contributions, but also in-service distributions, and any gains before the distribution are subject to taxes.  


I just learned another way of doing this is if your provider allows for in-plan conversions! This lets you contribute to the after-tax bucket, then convert it to a Roth 401k instead. Giving you the same tax sheltered access you'd get in a Roth IRA. I called my provider about this (Fidelity) and they not only knew exactly what i was talking about, they were excited about it and even set it up to automatically convert, so there is no chance for gains complicating the process. It was one phone call, that I never have to think about again. The downsides are of course being tied to your employer's 401k options, and the regular 401k penalties if you need to withdraw.  


I just wanted to share this because there is always such an emphasis on in-service distributions, which are rare, that I thought the Mega Backdoor Roth wasn't an option at all for me.   


If there's any important details I missed please let me know. This is new info to me that I just wanted to get the word out about but by no means am I an expert.","self","https://redd.it/lzbuke"

Bond yields were very high historically, 2-4% REAL returns even with Government bonds, this is why the 4% rule worked so well. But if you have 40% in bonds yielding a measly 1-1.5% today (nominal!) with the additional risk that future rate rises will totally crush their value, I don't see how the 4% rule is relevant today. A 40% bond portfolio (with high quality gov and IG corporate bonds) would have wayy expected lower return these days, with well under inflation interest rates. Am I missing something? Did the 4% rule study actually test time periods where bond/interest rates were near 0 and stocks were at near record valuations like today?

In this subreddit, we're often concerned with the long-term return outlook of various asset classes because we're often looking at accumulation-decumulation timelines on the order of decades. But what should we do about spending goals in the much shorter term? Here I want to highlight a set of pages that are quite useful when considering asset location and allocation for the short term.

The Bogleheads wiki has three sister pages on historical returns for [6-month](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_\(6_months\)), [1-year](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_\(1_year\)), and [5-year](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_\(5_years\)) savings horizons.

In each page, they list a multitude of ETFs and mutual funds that one might consider as an alternative to cash (in the articles, represented by the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund [VMMXX]). They do this by demonstrating a few key statistics comparing that holding (e.g. VTSAX) vs VMMXX for all overlapping durations where they have comparative data (e.g. all 6-month overlapping periods. Statistics presented include (but are not limited to):

* What *percentage* of overlapping periods experienced underperformance relative to VMMXX? (Note that a fund with the exact same long term performance as VMMXX but with uncorrelated results will have an expected underperformance of 50%.)
* *In periods where the fund underperformed*, what was the typical dollar amount of the underperformance? (Both mean and median are presented.)
* What was the largest loss ever recorded for that time period in the historical record?
* What is your expected reward for taking the risk? They present the mean and median return compared to VMMXX over all periods available.

So if you're looking at a 6-month savings window, how would you do with [VTSAX](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_\(6_months\)#VTSAX:_Vanguard_Total_Stock_Market_Index)?

* VTSAX underperformed the benchmark money market fund in 27.3% of 6-month windows.
* *When* VTSAX underperformed, it lost on average $929 (median $705) compared to VMMXX. (Recall this is from a $10,000 investment.)
* The largest loss compared to VMMXX in a 6-month period was $4,348.
* Your reward for taking the above risk was an average return of $410 above VMMXX's performance (median $518).

This highlights the common advice that a 100% equity fund is too risky for a 6-month time horizon. Your median risk premium in a 6-month window has been an extra $518, but one quarter of the time you'd lose compared to VMMXX and when you lost you'd have a median loss of $705. You also run the risk of a *much* higher loss of >$4,000.

How about [using VTSAX for a 5-year savings horizon](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Using_mutual_funds_and_ETFs_for_short-term_savings_\(5_years\)#VTSAX:_Vanguard_Total_Stock_Market_Index)?

* VTSAX underperformed the benchmark money market fund in 28.3% of 60-month windows.
* *When* VTSAX underperformed, it lost on average $1,736 (median $1,673) compared to VMMXX. (Recall this is from a $10,000 investment.)
* The largest loss compared to VMMXX in a 60-month period was $4,542.
* Your reward for taking the above risk was an average return of $5,179 above VMMXX's performance (median $5,141).

This is a good example of the classic risk and reward of equities in a short/medium-term window. Interestingly, in the 5-year period your chances of underperforming a money market fund are not substantially different (in fact, just a smidge higher in the longer window), but when you do lose money it's proportionally less over the longer horizon (i.e. it's not 10x the median loss over a 10x longer horizon). It's also the case that if you do lose money, your maximum loss can still be quite deep. The reward, though, is a median return 10x higher than it was for the 6-month return window. So if you can stomach the idea of a potential 45% loss even after 5 years, you stand to gain quite a bit (50%) over what the money market fund would've given you.

Lastly, if you are considering saving a substantial amount over a 6-60 month period and find an asset that's right for you, consider [placing this cash- or conservative-fund in a tax-advantaged account](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Placing_cash_needs_in_a_tax-advantaged_account). The idea is that you can hold tax-efficient stocks in your taxable brokerage while holding the safe asset in a 401k. When it comes time to make your purchase, you'd sell the tax-efficient stocks and take a smaller tax hit while also selling the safe asset in the 401k and buying stocks. Overall, it acts as if you held the safe asset in the taxable brokerage all along and after you make the relevant sales it's as if you never sold the stock. **Major caveat**: Your taxable portfolio in stocks needs to be large enough to weather a major downturn. If you're holding $30k in stocks for a down payment and the market tanks 50%, you now only have $15k available for a down payment even though you're holding $30k in safe assets in your tax-advantaged account. A decent rule of thumb is that your taxable account should be twice whatever the eventual spending need would be in order to maintain your ability to use the funds even after a major drop. All the above logic holds for something like an emergency fund as well.","self","https://redd.it/lztg6e"

I have questions about a fairly specific set of circumstances and I'd love to see if there are relevant experiences the community can share, though hopefully this will be interesting even for folks who are on different tracks. I know there is ExpatFire for this kind of question as well, but hoping to cast a wider net here. 

Here's some setup**:**

**Age:** Mid-thirties couple

**Family:** We're expecting our first baby this year, and it's pretty likely we're going to stop at one.

**Location and income:** We are fortunate to have high incomes, and as a tradeoff we live in a VHCOL area (SF Bay Area), which other than the cost, we generally quite like (weather, food, culture). 

**Housing**: \~$400K equity in a very affordable (for here) home which should be pretty comfortable for a family for 3. Edit: pretty comfortable until she's 3 and then we'd probably want a larger house with a proper yard.

**Savings outlook:** We save about 75% of our gross income so NW is going up quickly. Should cross $2M by the end of this year, including the home equity. Maybe 3.5M by age 38. and 5M by age 40, which would be close to when the little one is school age.

**Now the question**: We have had a dream (**Plan A**) for a while of moving when we FIRE, either to an EU country like Portugal/Spain or to somewhere else in the western US with lower cost of living and not a huge downgrade in weather and amenities (maybe San Diego or some parts of Colorado). That feels very doable with $3M saved and an earlier retirement date. The alternative (**Plan B**) would be to work for a few more years to save up more to FIRE where we are - I think we'd need at least $5M to feel comfortable here, possibly more. Right now I think Plan A is still very feasible even with the little one, but wondering if I'm being naive and whether I'll end up thinking Plan B makes more sense after they're born. For those who have had geo arbitrage FIRE plans, and then had a young child, did the kid change your plans and sensibilities? Did it make you want to save more for their future (i.e. generational wealth) than you otherwise would have, or stay somewhere more HCOL to give them better opportunities/keep them where you have roots? Interested in how you thought about the tradeoffs in this kind of scenario.","self","https://redd.it/m006ya"

Consider the following scenarios:

* Bob retires at 55 with annual spending of $40k of his $1m net worth (4%). He probably needs to worry about sequence of returns risk. So let's say he sets up a 10 year 80/20 to 100/0 glidepath. At the end of the 10 years, he has a net worth of $2m.
* Tom is the same age as Bob, and retires 10 years later than Bob, with the same $40k annual spending as Bob, and with the same net worth of $2m. Tom's withdrawal rate is 2%.

Tom is identical to Bob (after 10 years). The market doesn't know how they got there.

If Bob can be 100% equities after 10 years, then Tom should be able to skip the glidepath and be 100% equities from the start. But I don't think I've ever seen that analysis. What is the SWR and retirement period combination that suggests that a person doesn't need to have an equity glidepath?

Instead, it seems like the recommendation would be that Tom also set up a glidepath. But that can't be right, because that would suggest that Bob should still be in bonds after 10 years.

The only way I can think to get a handle on this is to use cFireSim, adjusting the withdrawal rate for Tom until the success percentage matches the success percentage of Bob, who starts 10 years earlier with an equity glidepath.

A related scenario is that Bob has an amazing 5 years, and hits $2m. Why not abort his glidepath and go 100% equities? Aside from the extra 5 years of longevity risk, it seems like the outcome is more or less the same. I suppose one could argue that CAPE is higher, and the market will ""revert to the mean"", but if we could all predict the market we'd be rich right?","self","https://redd.it/m09466"

I have today had a sudden life realization upon being unemployed and quarantined. **OBSESSING OVER MONEY WILL NOT MAKE YOU HAPPY!**

I've been subscribed to this whole philosophy for as long as high school. During that time I would completely shut myself away from the outside world if it wasn't related to studies. Studying would be all I ever did with the exception of Saturday nights in hope of good grades so I could attend a more competitive career thus more money. It would be a constant chase for the unobtainable to one day finally be financially independent. And I would even live in ghetto apartments to early adulthood to save more money regardless of income.

I applied the same mentality of discipline after HS and to the professional life as well. All I did on the weekends were waking up, go to work, go home, eat sleep then repeat. All I did on weekends were trying to spend as little money as possible and meal prepping for the upcoming week. I would just wait out the weekends and prepare for upcoming work.

I lived like this for over 10  years until I got unemployed and was forced into lockdown. I get an orgasm every time I check my portfolio but get depressed once I glance at all the things I missed out in life. My work is such a big part of my identity that once I lost it I have nothing to live for besides my money regardless of what work opportunities I have.

In the pursuit of FIRE I realized I have missed out so many opportunities to bond with potential friends and a future partner during the process of FIRE. Lonlines and depression is starting to creep in.

I also realized in the pursuit of FIRE that I have missed out so many opportunities to broaden my life experiences. I can't partake in most small talk that's not work related. I feel obligated to lie about myself to not appear shallow. Whenever someone talks about their love lives, traveling, dining out or whatever it may be I just shy out of ignorance.

If your life is not fulfilling at the present you will not feel any difference once you're FIRE. Live for the moment but also for the future. Focus and live for the present before focusing on the future.

I'd rather sacrifice some part of my net worth upon my death bed in order to not die without friends and family and dying with life experiences.

Anyone else thinking they should have lived life more?

What I'm trying to do is decide how my knowledge of future payments from Social Security should affect my stock/bond asset allocation ratio.

Here is a potential approach I've come up with that I'd like some opinions on.

Lets say that I'm 60, and I know that at age 70 Social Security will pay me $40,000/year, and I'm sure that I'm going to wait until I'm 70 before I ask the government to start sending the money.  If we pretend that Social Security is a ""bond"" that magically always grows at 4% each and every year, whether or not we are withdrawing from it, then we can say that the bond is worth $1M at age 70.  If we extrapolate backwards, that would give the bond a current valuation of around \~$676K.  It will grow at 4% for 10 years, and then continue to grow but we'll be pulling $40K out every year at that point.

If I've currently got e.g. $1M in a brokerage, that I've decided to split 50/50 between stocks and bonds, wouldn't it make sense to say that I've ""really"" got around $1.7M, and put $850K in stocks to give me the desired ratio?

I'm sure there must be some flaws in my logic, but I can use some help figuring out what they are.  Is there a better way to approach this?","self","https://redd.it/m0x4b7"

The biggest correction I've done for this type of operational failure was over $200K.

# What is an MDO?

If your employer doesn't allow you to defer money from your 401(k) plan, but you are eligible to participate in the plan, they owe you money.

There is a subset of the DOL called EBSA that takes this very seriously. If you [call them](https://dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/about-us/regional-offices), the issue will (eventually) be corrected. However, I recommend speaking to your employer first. If they don't view it as an issue, let them know there are hefty penalties they may have to pay...and the DOL just made them, literally, 10 times worse.

# Common Example of Failure

1. You were not automatically enrolled as intended
2. You changed your election amounts (e.g. 3% up to 6%), but the change was never made
3. Your employer keeps saying they will get to it, but they don't. I recommend sending this via email for records, whether or not you speak to them directly.
4. Someone forgot to start deferring money when you became eligible
5. HR person went on vacation when you became eligible and there was a delay

# How Much Does My Employer Owe Me?

Your employer owes up to 50% of the amount you elected to defer (i.e. the MDO), and 100% of the match you would have received, plus interest. The MDO + interest are deposited to your account as a qualified non-elective contribution (QNEC), which is 100% vested. The match you would have received + interest, which I will now just refer to as match, is subject to standard vesting requirements.

# Why Am I Only Receiving 50% of My Deferral?

The government views this as a joint failure between employee and employer. You still received the money you were owed, it just wasn't tax-deferred, and now your employer has to pay you twice.

Keep in mind this is my understanding of the government's rationale, and not necessarily my personal opinion on the matter.

# I Told My Employer, But Didn't Receive A QNEC!

This might be correct, but it's very unlikely if you notify them of the issue.

**Example 1 - 0% QNEC**

Your employer must begin correct deferrals by the earlier of:

* the end of the month following the month you notified them of the issue, or,
* on or before 3 months from the date the error occurred.

They must also give notices to affected participants within 45 days of the date correct deferrals began. This notice must contain specific details, one of which is the amount they will be depositing into your account...and I doubt they will have the calculations completed in that time-frame. However, if they manage to do all that correctly, you are owed a 0% QNEC and 100% match.

Example A:

* Employer notified of issue by you on: 03/09/21
* Correct deferrals must begin on or before: 06/09/21
* Employer begins correct deferrals on: 03/30/21
* Notice must be given on or before: 05/14/21
* If correction is made and notice is given on or before 05/14/21, you are owed a 0% QNEC and 100% match. Otherwise, see example 2.

**Example 2 - 25% QNEC**

Your employer must begin correct deferrals by the earlier of:

* the end of the month following the month you notified them of the issue, or,
* on or before the last day of the plan year following the year the error occurred.

They still have to give the notices, so again...it's unlikely for your employer to qualify for a 25% QNEC. However, if they manage to do it all correctly, they owe you a 25% QNEC and 100% match.

Example B:

* Employer notified of issue by you on: 03/09/21
* Correct deferrals must begin on or before: 12/31/22
* Employer begins correct deferrals on: 08/30/21
* Notice must be given on or before: 10/14/21
* If correction is made and notice is given on or before 10/14/21, you are owed a 25% QNEC and 100% match. Otherwise, see example 3.

**Example 3 - Plan With Auto-Enrollment Feature**

If the plan has an auto-enrollment feature, and you didn't notify your employer of the issue, they have 9 1/2 months to begin correct deferrals. They are still required to supply a notice with 45 days of the date correct deferrals begin. Fortunately, there is a ""sunset"" on this rule, so it only applies for failures occurring on or before 12/31/2020.

Example C:

* Employer notified of issue by you on: 01/01/21
* Not eligible for Auto-Enrollment safe harbor (i.e. pay you a 0% QNEC or 25% QNEC), because the failure occurred after 12/31/20

Example D:

* Employer notified of issue by you on: 03/09/20
* Correct deferrals must begin on or before: 01/15/21
* Employer begins correct deferrals on: 01/15/21
* Notice must be given on or before: 03/01/21
* You are owed a 0% QNEC and 100% match

Example E:

* Employer notified of issue by you on: 03/09/20
* Correct deferrals must begin on or before: 01/15/21
* Employer begins correct deferrals on: 01/16/21
* Notice must be given on or before: 03/01/21
* You are owed a 50% QNEC and 100% match

**Example 4 - Other Scenarios**

If your situation doesn't fall under any of the example listed above, you are most likely owed a 50% QNEC and 100% match.

# Does It Work For My Plan?

Unless you have some sort of collective bargaining agreement or 457 account, yes, this likely applies to your retirement plan.

So...this got a lot longer than I expected, but I'm trying to snipe out questions before you ask them.

1. Ownership.  I'm the business owner and don't report to anyone else.
2. Reliable income (needn't be consistent but should be reliable, i.e. some weeks might be down and some up but overall the droughts don't last more than a couple of months)
3. \~$30-$40k baseline income for low effort (\~20 hours a week) but high correlation between effort and income in case I want to increase my effort some months to make up for a shortfall
4. Locality: easy for any one of us to start up, but difficult for the ""big guy"" in the country to displace us.  Also something that Redditors on this thread are comfortable sharing (i.e. it's not some obscure stock trade you've perfected).
5. Moderately low barrier to entry (price for entry might be capital investment <$100k but ideally not a license that requires >1 year to obtain).

So my question is, what businesses are you all doing on the side that have one or more of these characteristics?

*Note: This is the first time a spreadsheet of the 2017 results has been released, originally it was displayed via a website that is now defunct. The 2018 and 2017 results are partial - all respondents were able to opt in or out of being in the spreadsheet, so only those who opted in are included. In 2020 respondents who did not want to be in the spreadsheet were not allowed to complete the survey. The 2017 format is a little different because the survey was done in SurveyMonkey, as opposed to Google Forms for 2018 & 2020. 2017 also suffered from lack of clarity in the time period responses should cover, which was corrected in later versions.*","self","https://redd.it/m1q8ia"

We max out all of our tax-advantaged accounts and throw any extra funds into our taxable account, which is invested similarly. I fully believe in this approach and invest 99% of my money in this way. 

However I reserve about 1% of my portfolio for playing around with individual stocks that are a bit more volatile. I've found this helps keep me engaged in the market and I treat it as a hobby. It is a laughably small amount of money, but because of the more speculative nature of some of my investments I have seen decent returns. I've heard others on the path to FIRE say they have a similar setup, with 5-10% reserved as ""play"" money. 

My question is, when these stocks produce significant short-term returns what do you choose to do with that money? Do you increase your pot of play money or do you treat it as extra income (in a nonlegal sense) that you can throw into your less risky investment accounts? Do you spend it on something that might not fit into your FIRE spending plan otherwise? I don't think there is a wrong answer, I'm just curious how people merge potential short-term gains with a more conservative long-term philosophy.","self","https://redd.it/m1qt58"

I’m a U.S. citizen and I plan on staying in the states the whole time. Always had health insurance through my employer as an adult so I’m clueless how this all works.

I have the expenses side of things figured out except the health insurance part so I’m trying to estimate that cost and make sure I’m not missing something. No major health issues, not on any meds, in my late 20’s, work out on a regular basis, and eat pretty healthy so I’d plan on getting minimum coverage.

The two options I’m aware of are
1. COBRA insurance
2. Purchase a plan through healthcare. gov

Are those the best/most cost effective options to consider or are there others I should be looking into? Tell me if I’m wrong, but I believe COBRA is generally more expensive since your employer usually covers the majority of the monthly cost while working.

Also, any additional advice or thoughts on this would be appreciated.","self","https://redd.it/m2bo4o"

This flexibility means we can get a little experience under our belt and take the time to really enjoy our time together instead of just putting out proverbial fires.

This upcoming time off got me thinking about using it as practice for retiring early. Obviously the emphasis will be spending time and bonding with the kid, but I'd like to use it as a trial run to see what life is like for a long stretch without answering emails, sitting in meetings, and instead having a schedule completely driven by myself and my family. I'm about 8 years or so away from FI, and feeling good about every aspect of that side of the equation. What I'm unsure about is the RE portion. I'm great at unplugging while on vacation, during weekends, and after hours - but I've never been unplugged from a job for over two weeks. This is a tremendous opportunity to test RE with a safety net and I want to take full advantage of it.

For folks that have RE'd or used a trial run (paternity, sabbatical, etc.), what was the initial strategy for spending your time? What was your initial outlook and plan? And what were your learnings? I'm looking for more than ""do your hobbies"" because I know I'll be pretty good at that. I'm interested in better understanding the mindset and how that may have been altered over time.

My current company doesn’t offer a 401k plan, they do a 401b and a pension. I don’t intend to stay with this company for the long haul and am looking to swap companies probably within the year.

That being said, is it an okay idea to setup a Roth IRA and 401k outside of a job? I know I don’t get the company match that way, but I’m not eligible for employer contributions regardless as I haven’t been with the company long enough.

It's been a few years and I finally got around to posting an update. Here's my [last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/92paf7/29m_single_no_kids_just_hit_300000_net/) for those who are interested.

First off, I wanted to say thank you for all the comments on my last post. I read every single one. They were incredibly helpful and I am forever grateful to have access to this community.

The goal of this update is exactly the same as the last time I posted:
> First and foremost, I hope that this post can serve as some sort of inspiration for someone or, at the very least, provide some sort of value. Second, maybe someone more experienced than I can give me some pointers.

So let's get to to it!

**Liabilities**

Asset | Amount | Note

___

**Investment Strategy**

I max out my 401k, HSA, and Roth IRA. Moving forward I will have to contribute to my Roth IRA via the backdoor Roth approach as I am over the income limit. I would love to do a mega-backdoor Roth but my 401k provider doesn't allow it. 

Following this, I contribute to my index funds. I'm still pretty much doing the ""[Core Four Lazy Portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#Core_four_portfolios)"" with the following allocations:

Fund | Percent
---|---|----
VTSAX | 70%
VTIAX | 12%
VBTLX | 10%
VNQ | 8%

Every once in a while I throw some money at a particular stock or ETF. I currently hold $MSOS, $GME, $ACDVF, $ARKK, and $LKYSF. I'm in the green on all of them except $ARKK but we are in a bull market and I have no clue what I'm doing so let's just chalk that up to luck. It's <2% of my NW.
___

**Expenses**

Honestly, I stopped aggressively tracking my expenses. I know they have gone up largely because I moved back to the United States. I bought a $1,500 car when I got back and my rent is $600/month including bills. I still cook at home. I don't buy a lot of things and I don't have an Amazon account. In truth, I'm more opposed to unnecessary consumption than I am to spending money nowadays. I still keep it pretty light and that's good enough tracking for me.

___

**Previous Comments** 

I did want to address some comments from my last post:

> /u/WoodKlearing Unless I’m misreading the numbers, ditch the rental immediately. Huge liability for a paltry return. You can get out and easily make way more in the market with no hassle.

I just love that you used to word paltry. In all seriousness, a lot of you were telling me to ditch my rental property. That was, and continues to be, the right choice but I have been a lazy boy. Luckily, since my last post, the house appreciated over $125,000. Assuming the market holds, I will sell this property once the tenants move out later this year.

> /u/electroze Gauging by your post you might put disproportionate time into cutting expenses instead of increasing income. There's diminishing returns on cutting expenses, but not necessarily on income- the sky is the limit.

> /u/BusyMom1234  Do you love your job a lot? You are losing money by just staying in that job. $110,000 for a director in tech? Unless you love that one, time to switch! Engineers can earn more than that.

> /u/kshdhsjks  If you’re in tech, you should have been making $130k every year for eight years already. You’re great at saving... but you need to focus on income generation.

These comments changed my thought process and were inevitably what lead me to pursue a higher-paid position.

> /u/mansausage  Um, you think $3k in individual stocks was a bad idea but you have $20k in crypto?

It wasn't surprising to see a lot of crypto hate in the comments given the sub. I ended up with about $80k in crypto from that initial $16k investment before I sold it. I'll be buying back in if it crashes again. I believe in it.

> /u/Bryanhenry  How did you make that graph of expenses ? Sorry im sure this has been posted 1000000 times

It sure was. I was using a Chrome extension called Sankey Snip but switched to using [this website](https://sankeycash.com/).

> /u/kshdhsjks I have no idea why they are paying you so little money and I have no idea why you’ve moved away to experience life with so little real work experience. Forget Chile. Move back to the US. Get a real job with your fancy title.

I have gotten a few comments like this. Refer to the **Final Words** section of my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/92paf7/29m_single_no_kids_just_hit_300000_net/) for my thoughts on this.

**Salary Increases for Software Developers**

I wanted to include this section because I know this question will come up if this post gets any attention. If you are a software developer and you are interested in increasing your compensation, I posted [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/m3a50t/investment_portfolio_critique/gqnuk7i/) in /r/Bogleheads with my general approach. It's somewhat broad so let me know if you have any other questions.
___

**Final Words**

It's been a wild ride to say the least. I have clearly been all over the place but I can't say I regret any of it.

I have been thinking a lot lately about the [""Build the life you want, then save for it""](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/58j8pc/build_the_life_you_want_then_save_for_it/) thread by /u/MrLlamaSC that has been stickied to the sidebar of this subreddit for some time.

> I had focused so hard on my retirement goal that I almost based my life success on how well I was doing on getting to that.

> I got so focused on the potential future that I stopped living in the present.

> If I'm miserable during the accumulation phase, I'm still going to be miserable afterwards.

> I look back at the past few years of my life and at my bank account and I would gladly give away a hefty chunk of it and work longer if it meant I could have experienced more of the world and found more passions I could have for the rest of my life, especially with someone I had loved so much.

> I built my savings but never built my life.

I see these *""Hit my FI number. Now what?*"" posts. You know, that's what scares me the most about hyper-focusing on work and wealth accumulation. Call me a millennial but that, among other reasons, is why I'm so quick to jump ship the second I'm not happy. 

I know not everyone has six-figure salaries. I know not everyone is child-free, mortgage-free, or debt-free. But there's a middle-ground here. And I think we owe it to ourselves to establish that middle-ground and make sure we don't stray too far from it.

Without knowing it, I've been on a Coast FIRE plan for a few decades.  I was single, fairly well paid in Silicon Valley, and living comfortably cheap (renting a room from a friend, modest high-mileage car, international travel as part of my work, volunteering a lot, happy to eat out regularly with friends), giving money away and investing the rest.  I inherited a couple of key commitments from my dad: (1) spend less than you make and (2) compound interest is miraculous. (He gave me a little money when I was 16, with the condition I'd meet with his broker and invest it.  Thanks tons for the lesson, Dad!)

My relationship to work seems to be an unusual one. When I was in graduate school, the folks paying my fellowship checked up with me each year to see how I was doing. I thought I needed to prove myself, that I was making sufficient progress toward the degree. But their only question was, ""Is there anyone or anything getting in the way of your doing what you think you should be doing?"" Since then, at each job, I've worked out a partnership where I'm doing what I think should be done, contributing my gifts as best I can for something that matters and I enjoy. Compensation is a good indicator that other people find it valuable too.

So at age 34, I was able to negotiate a year off from my tech research job to go back to school. My savings meant a year without salary wasn't a problem. They held my job for me, and even indulged my studying a second year, and then working remotely for a couple of years while my newfound wife finished her education.  That eventually grew to three more years of studying toward a second PhD (again with no income, but frugality and savings made it manageable), in a much lower paying field, yielding a 75% pay cut but again doing what I wanted to do.

Fast forward.... I've been working for a non-profit for eight years. It's pulled together my strange combination of education and skills, with a lower salary than my tech years (about 50%), but a fully livable salary for our family of four in a MCOL city (""spend less than you make""), and the savings of my youth still quietly growing in the background.

A couple of years ago my work situation changed. New management and new philosophy. I'm less valued and even seen as a threat. I'm no longer involved in the decisions that matter. We butt heads over some of those decisions. I decide this is no longer ""doing what I want to be and should be doing.""  So I resigned, effective next month.

At first I was scrambling for what my next thing might be. But then I decided to think soberly about our financial situation and lay out a ""what if?"" scenario if there is no next step that generates compensation. Lo and behold, my set-it-and-forget-it portfolio has done really well, and it looks like I'm at a very comfortable 2.5% withdrawal rate, even with additional health costs and having some fun with the extra time. So I think I just accidentally FIREd at age 54.

That said, I don't think I'm done. I've got a few friends reaching out to me to draw me into their ventures. The fear side of me makes me want to jump into something new, to not be spending money I'm not actively earning, but the FIRE voice keeps reminding me that I can be selective. I don't want to get into a bad situation just because I'm on the rebound.

Maybe my story will spark some helpful conversations. A few summary thoughts:

1. Saving early, if you can do it, yields tons of freedom.
2. FI (including being on a trajectory that is confidently leading to FI) isn't just about quitting working. It leads to the freedom to make unconventional career choices for building a meaningful life.
3. Don't be afraid of an upside down view of work, if it fits your situation: I've not begrudgingly let myself ""be used"" by my employer to accomplish their goals in exchange for money to pay my bills. I've ""used"" (or better, found synergy with) my employer, so that we're simultaneously accomplishing both our goals. In other words, I seek out an employer I can leverage toward a good thing I want to accomplish, and getting paid is a good indicator that we're doing something worthwhile together. I recognize not everyone can do this, and I'm deeply grateful that I could.
4. Cal Newport's [*So Good They Can't Ignore You*](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124) (along with his companion: [*Deep Work*](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/)) resonate with me. Newport's philosophy of building career capital in order to gain career autonomy and meaning really complements my take on the FIRE philosophy, even if it's not a fit for everyone.
5. Writing down a concrete post-FIRE plan (including cash flow, health insurance details, contingency plans for unexpected expenses, how to spend time the first few months) can remove lots of angst about resigning and launching into the unknown.

I've done a lot right.  I've maxed my retirement savings for many years and my wife has as well.  We have no real debt besides our mortgage and we've been aggressively paying that off and saving/investing whatever else we can.  I know how much $ we will need per year retiring with a very nice lifestyle and that's all taken care of.  We will keep contributing as long as we can so it's only going to increase.  Plus I have a few long shot investment kind of things (selling a business when I retire) that should just add to that.

But......we have 3 kids.  And presumably those kids will go to college.  While they may qualify for some scholarships and grants, they are NOT going qualify for anything related to being lower income.  We've saving for each of their college funds too of course but I literally have no idea how to plan for the expense of college in the context.  It doesn't even make sense to me that adults (aka, my kids at 18) are considered old enough to vote and go to war and get loans but for some reason their parents are supposed to contribute to their college costs.  That's just me wanting the world to make sense though.

Now granted, my wife and I WANT to help.  I do not want to see them in a mountain of debt of course.  But I just have no idea how to plan for it.  My financial advisor basically said it doesn't matter which pot the money is in - if you have it the college is going to expect you to contribute.   So at this point we have our liquid investments in a variety of growth and safer investments plus we have 3 accounts for the kids that will become self directed when they hit 21.  Those will be for education use primarily.

The oldest one will have 4 more years of school after this spring.  The younger two will graduate high school in 8 years (yay twins!).  They're all pretty bright so the sky (and the tuition costs) are the limit.  I have no idea how to plan for this.  The oldest one wants to go to MIT or another high end engineering school - so far she has the grades to support it.  It goes without saying I do not have the $280,000 four years at MIT costs in her education account.  I really don't know how to plan for a cost that could be from $xx,xxx to $xxx,xxx for each of 3 different daughters.

**My crazy backstory:**

I started a social media marketing business in college at 20 years old. The company scaled from ""paying for meals"" to peaking at $450,000/yr gross in its final year (age 23) with high profit margins. I ran the company for 3 years before the niche became obsolete. It's a long story but almost over night it scaled back down to $0. The nature of the business and crazy return on investments I was seeing also led me to reinvest 75%+ of my income for most of the time span of the company. My line of work only required about 1-10 hours of work per week from myself. Most of the business was automated and I had up to 10 independent contractors at a time pitching in work. During that time I was young and dumb and spent lavishly going on 15+ vacations per year. I thought being flashy was cool so I spent a decent amount of money on name brands like gucci. All the while, I knew the business was volatile so I stayed in college continuing my computer science degree. My business failed at age 23, and I graduated with my B.S. in computer science at age 24. The year the business failed I was left with $127,000 in a checking account net after all expenses were paid. Over the course of the next year I continued the ""lavish"" lifestyle and ended up with $43,000 leftover when I got my first job at age 24. I worked my first job for 1 year making $67,000 per year.

&#x200B;

**Where I am now:**

1 year into my first job I decided to job hop and upped my salary to $93,000 per year. I've been at this job for 1 year since. I also have some niche side hustles that are mostly automated with code that I write in my freetime. Those bring in around $10,000 additional income per year. I am in a LCOL major city. I am not married and do not have kids. I own a 7 year old low-mileage car that I paid $11,000 cash for (not included in NW). I invest in index funds, VTSAX to be specific. I play with about $6,000 in meme stocks/crypto (included in my brokerage totals below). If VTSAX is not available in an account, I purchase a standard mixture of large cap, mid/small cap, and international index funds. I do not own a home, I rent. I do have a $25,000 down payment in my HYSA ready to purchase a house, but renting makes a lot more sense to me right now and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Below I have laid out every penny of my finances.

&#x200B;

**The future?:**

I now have 2 years of experience in the software engineering field. I'm considering attempting another job hop either sometime this year or next. I'd consider the company I currently work at to be 2nd tier (huge name company, but not a tech company). My dream is to get into a tier 1 job such as google, facebook, amazon, netflix. I have a lot of studying to do before I can even consider applying to these jobs though.

&#x200B;

I'd love to hear feedback whether good or bad. Please feel free to give input/advice and I am open to answer any questions :)

As you may have seen, the [Official 2020 FI Survey Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/m1q8ia/official_2020_fi_survey_results/) are in, and I couldn't be more excited to dig through the data!  I created the [2018 Survey Analysis](https://supplychenmanagement.com/2018/04/07/initial_fire_2018_survey/) a few years ago, and I saw this as another cool passion project opportunity. As I was combing through the data, there were so many amazing attributes.  I decided to create an app in the meantime with the core attributes to let everyone play around with the data, giving me some time to organize the laundry list of attributes better.

A part of me is very dismissive of posting here because the predominant discourse revolves around having enough to be frugal, which means that you have enough money to choose to skip certain things, and I might just delete this post and never hit submit...

I want to know if it's still possible to work towards FI, even if it's something I'm going to have to frame differently if I want to survive at all. If so, what can I possibly do? I feel lost, scared, I haven't been able to sleep more than an hour for several days.","self","https://redd.it/m4qvow"

Essentially what we're doing is investing in future time. We save and make decent decisions that allow us to buy back time at a certain age, with us putting a monetary value against said time (e.g. 25k a year).

However its worrying when you read about people with illnesses or disabilities at what we may consider an early age (say when you want to go FI). I used to just simplistically assume I live forever and be healthy for a very long time without putting the groundwork in. 

It has made me think that there really are two types of investments we can make, to ensure *time* becomes even more valuable when you FI:
* invest financially (to buy time) 
* invest in your body and mind (to make use of time) 

With the former, you have a higher chance of FI early and with the latter, you have a higher chance of being able to enjoy that new found spare time.

A lot of us have sedentary office jobs (IT etc.). If we don't put any ground work into stimulating our brains (reading, being creative, learning new skills) or our bodies (exercising, conditioning) then it's going to be harder to suddenly develop those habits when you FI.

Of course some people don't care about the non-financial aspect but I've come to realise it's possibly more important than having that extra 100k when you retire.

So I am a salaried employee and currently receive 20 days of “vacation” each year (you don’t use it when you’re sick, strictly vacation) in addition to holidays. It’s a very flexible work from home arrangement and management is incredibly supportive of time off. That increases every year from here on out and will top off at 23 days.

Each year, we are given the option to sell or buy 5 days. So, you could take 28 work days off every year.

All this time, I’ve been selling days to earn more money to save and invest. I see the path to FI as simply buying our freedom.

So today it clicked - I will be buying 5 days every year, instead of selling, and taking as much time off as possible. Why not buy more freedom now (with a family), it hardly makes a dent in our finances to do so.

Anybody else take a similar approach?","self","https://redd.it/m4xnnv"

Prior to that, I had a pretty unstable life situation (immigrant on a work visa at a stressful company) and just held all my money in cash, didn't even put much in a 401k, because I didn't know when I'd have to leave the country. 

Since then, I worked towards getting my green card, and began investing my money and maxing out my 401k. I now own a home with my husband and we have a child. I have decent savings and investments that if I were to lose my job, I'd still be able to cover our mortgage for years. I'm happy with my progress.

That said, I wish I had started on this much earlier. I had several good opportunities in the past decade that I didn't take with both hands for reasons I'll elaborate below. If I had had that single minded dedication to my goals, I'd probably have at least a million dollars in savings and investments by now, and that would have made me feel okay with just taking 2-5 years off to be a mom. 

My net worth now is now about $650k which is not bad at all, but it feels like I haven't given my best to my career or my finances, and now I need to ""do it all"". 

Reasons why I didn't do my best:

* Ignorance. I knew I didn't want to work beyond 40. But it just seemed like an impossible goal. I would mention this to my friends and family and people would think I was joking. Everyone came at it with the idea of ""yeah it sucks, but you gotta do it"". Why? Because you gotta. 

* I was very unhappy with my line of work (tech). I had to work in big tech companies because only they would sponsor my visa. I didn't like my work not having any effect on the final product. I had no motivation to show up at work, and even less motivation to figure out how to get as much money as possible. 

* Too scared to invest. You know that line from 30 rock - ""I have 12 grand in checking"" / ""what are you, an immigrant?"". That was true for me. I didn't know how to do stocks and shares. I knew even less about bonds. I didn't want to get into any trouble or lose my money owing to stupid mistakes. I had my bank account frozen a few times whenever the US had issues with iran because my bank had me down wrongly as an Iranian for years before it was fixed. That scared me even more, and I didn't want to lose my money or my freedom. I only started trading on robinhood after the 2016 elections because my husband said stocks are on sale, buy them now. 

* Instability, which led to no concrete goals. I didn't even imagine buying a house because I might just get fired whenever and have to leave the country within a month. I didn't want to keep significant assets in America. At the same time, I didn't feel like I wanted to go back home for various reasons. So it felt like I was biding my time till I got a green card, and then my life could start. 

Anyway. Once I discovered FIRE, I actually began tracking my finances and started investing back home in fixed deposits and such. Eventually I helped my family buy some property. I decided I was done with a career that was going nowhere and joined a startup that was work-hard-play-hard and which sponsored my green card. I spent my evenings taking classes to improve my career. I also started buying gold and silver because it would be easier to take back home in case I had to leave urgently. 

I'm glad I demonstrated this intent because I got my green card through marriage, which was much quicker than it would be through work, and I was in the right mindset to full on on investing, saving and maximizing income. 

In five years, I managed to up my net worth by $500k, find a line of work I liked, and buy property. I wish I'd started five years earlier. Investment instruments including stocks and property were very cheap in 2010-2011, and I could have afforded to invest money then. I would have been much better off financially and would not have needed to think twice about quitting to stay at home. Right now, my husband makes enough for me to stay at home in a pinch, but not for more than a year at most. 

That said, I got laid off a couple of years ago. Having been on the FIRE path, I felt pretty comfortable when in contrast my colleagues were losing their mind. I intended to take a break for ten weeks (length of my severance) and then begin looking, but about six weeks in, I was contacted by an employer who was offering me what was basically my dream work situation. I'm glad I decided to take that break, because I cleared my head about what I really wanted from my career after years of being in suboptimal work situations, and when my dream job came along, I was able to recognize it and say yes. 

So given all this, I'm glad I'm on the FIRE path, and I really wish I had started much earlier. Right now, I really wish I could spend all day with my child, but at the very least, I am happy I have a fully remote job that I enjoy, so it doesn't feel like I'm wasting my time at it when a stranger minds my baby.","self","https://redd.it/m58n8h"

Previously, we were the most bougie people possible: planning to retire in our mid-to-late 60s, figuring out how to maximize social security payments, and having what would be (by then) a healthy nest egg that would let us pick our retirement spot of choice and settle in with few worries about our finances. On the other hand... that's +/- 65 years old. As many people have said over the years, ""tomorrow is promised to no one."" We love to travel; I know that's a cliche, but we exclusively vacation overseas and our google map called ""Oh the places we'll go!"" has multiple layers and hundreds of pins.

So, we started re-doing the math. (re: the title of the post, we are 46 and 51 years old at the time) If we don't need to own a home in a relatively HCOL region, things get cheaper. If we leave the United States entirely, things get \*a lot\* cheaper. Plus, our biggest likely expense in retirement, travel, gets completely reworked if we start from a European hub instead of an American one. Even at this relatively late stage of life, if we employ most of the common strategies here in /r/financialindependence we were able to project a comfortable retirement at 55/60 instead of 60/65.

And then, just this week, we realized that one of the tentpoles of our plan wasn't even necessary. We were planning on using the ""golden visa"" program in Portugal, which while it's an investment and not just a cost, tying up \~$400k-$550k for several years was a stretch goal. It was fine, that was what we were bearing down to achieve over the next 5-ish years. But, if we skip that and just go the more traditional visa route, we don't need that nut. We can live on the nut we've been accumulating (largely in home equity) until we hit the first of our significant 401ks. (I mentioned we're old farts that have been doing things the old-fashioned way, right?)  In other words, instead of counting down the next 6 years here, in the old work/life model, we'll be counting down in our dream retirement environment. We've now pinky-promised ourselves that the next time there's a hiccup in either of our careers, instead of retrenching to make the next several years work, we're saying ""to hell with it"" and FIRE-ing. 

It does mean we aren't going to be living a life of (middle-class) luxury. We'll have to consider when to eat out and and when not to. We won't be taking the Orient Express just to fulfill an (incredibly expensive) wish list item. But, we'll get to all of the museums and archaeological sites, the beaches, the mountains... all of it. And we're far more likely to be healthy enough to enjoy it, even if we won't be in our 40s like some of the other success stories in here. We're very appreciative of the examples that are found in here, and I encourage any other lurkers to change your sensation of ""I can't do what they're doing"" (if that's what you've got) into ""I can do something more than I have been doing."" Retiring even a few years earlier than your friends, family, financial advisor etc... tell you is right will feel incredibly liberating.","self","https://redd.it/m5uwcb"

tl;dr. FIREd 6 months ago with $3.2 million. Since then, spent $40k of $50k expected.  Net worth increased by $1.1 million, $150k was investments, $1 million was bitcoin.   

&#x200B;

On Sept 15, 2020, we decided to FIRE.  At the time, we had $3.2 million, estimated spending of $100k / year for a withdrawal rate between 3.1%  We really were not sure on our spending, so we put 1 years worth of expected spending into a few dedicated accounts and track our spending for 6 months.  Today we examined our finances to see where we are at and plan for the future.  

&#x200B;

**Investments & Net Worth:**  

We started FIRE 6 months ago at $3.2 million.  We are currently at $4.3 million.  To be brutally honest, Bitcoin dominated our finances.  But even discounting that, we would be fine.  Our regular investments went up by $150k, so our $40k in spending was fully covered and then some.  If the money we had in bitcoin was in more traditional investments instead, our investments would have gone up by $200k total.  We have index funds with 80% equity / 20% bonds mix.  We also keep about 1 year's spending in cash.  So classic FIRE would work for us so far.  However, Bitcoin has gone to the moon.  Before FIRE, whenever bitcoin went up we felt the need to sell some to help secure our FIRE strategy.  After FIRE, we are not selling as agressively because we will be FIRE even if bitcoin drops like a rock.  

&#x200B;

**Spending:**  

Most of my spending is household monthly bills (utilities/phone/internet/insurance) and amazon.   My wife's spending is groceries, gifts, take-out and donations.  

&#x200B;

**Account strategy:**  

We put $100k into a few specific accounts.  The accounts turned into a mess that was hard to decipher.  A family member repaying a $1500 loan (we wrote off as a gift), my company paying me a last partial bonus, my wife using the CC to buy groceries (that I pay for) for elderly relatives and getting cash from them.  Hopefully the next 6 months is easier, but with buying a new car & a big income tax bill, it is going to be tough to allocate regular spending vs. one time spending.  

&#x200B;

**Personal:**  

I have not missed work at all.  I have been able to home school my kids, take up chess again, spend some time programming for fun and started to eat more healthy & get fit.  We did not travel or scuba due to the pandemic, but I have plans for several trips once we feel safe travelling.  

&#x200B;

**Future:**  

We have adjusted to have $100k in cash across our accounts & on hand.  This year is going to be big expenses - my wife is going to get a new car, and we will likely have a $50k - $80k income tax bill.  Plus, our home is 17 years old so we are going to replace every major appliance that has not already been replaced (furnace, A/C, hot water heater, clothes washer, basement freezer, patio furniture, BBQ).  

&#x200B;

Finally, as usual, I am a full bottle into a good Pinot, so I will responds tomorrow. It probably looks like I get drunk all the time, but I don't normally drink - last time was Christmas, and before 6 months ago on the first FIRE night :)","self","https://redd.it/m5vq2s"

Below is my networth and income since MBA:

https://imgur.com/a/mZ5D3ZP

A little about me:

1)  I went to a top-5 MBA program and graduated in 2016 (I graduated  undergrad in 2009). I had around negative $150k networth when I  graduated, and a little over negative $160k by the time I started  working in October 2016. The school ""should have"" put me around $180k in  debt, but $30k in internship money and $50k signing bonus helped  (although it largely went into me taking even more travel and buying an  engagement ring). The listed cost of my program (tuition + room/board +  suggested spending) was $180k. Most people went over this, as you spend 2  year traveling and drinking instead of learning.

2)  My net worth increased from negative $160k in October 2016 to positive  $385k today...for an increase in networth of $545k in 4 years and 5  months (4 year end bonus cycles). Market gains made up roughly $100-150k  of this. I think the assumption that I'd increase my networth by  $80-100k a year excluding market gains would be roughly accurate. 

3)  Consulting looks like it paid more than my current job, but it's a bit  of an illusion. The firm I signed with gave 2nd year tuition  reimbursement, in addition to year end of bonus....I'd have been looking  at $200k as engagement manager if I stayed, versus $225k I got from my  corporate strategy job. They did pay a bit below market, and I believe  they bumped up compensation across the board shortly after I left  though. 

4) My compensation has  stagnated a bit, partially due to not being in a client facing role  anymore. I'm barely beating inflation with my raises and bonus, despite  strong reviews. Consulting has much quicker salary appreciation.  However, my hours are great (I work literally half the hours), so can't  really complain. I currently make $180k base, $55k year end bonus, and  $15k 401k match contribution, so $250k. 

5)  I expect my next job - which I'm actively looking for - to give a  salary + bonus of $300k. My job is so easy now (but still cool and high  impact), I'm being probably too selective in choosing.

Overall,  I save 60-70% of my paycheck (tough to calculate accurately, since I  also get $15k in 401k match...I spend $15k a year or so on food and  restaurants, and split a nice one bedroom with my wife for a little over  $4k a month, and travel frequently (I usually churn points...I miss the  free travel from consulting though), so I don't think I live a very  frugal life despite high savings rate. This will obviously change once  we have kids though. 

As  you can see, MBA provides quick networth increases -along with a lot of  fun and lifetime friendships - but you do start from a rather large  hole. With expected salary progression and market returns, I expect to  retire with $5M in early 50s.","self","https://redd.it/m5vzoj"

My wife and I both max our 401ks and IRAs. Neither employer provides a path to Mega Backdoor Roth, and neither health plan allows for an HSA. So consider us ""maxed-out"" WRT tax-advantaged accounts, with some spillage, retirement-wise, into a taxable brokerage. Both plans have great funds with low expense ratios. In fact, mine is through Vanguard and my ER for a Target Retirement 2050 is like <0.05% or some nonsense. Anyway.

Our salaries are both \~$130K + similar bonuses. Her merit raises are usually around 5%, while mine is 3%.

Here are some plan-specific details:

***Her Plan***

* **Contributions:** Puts in 3% automagically, then matches 4.5% if she puts in 6% (total employee = 6%; total employer = 7.5%). She puts in 20% and bumps by 1%-2% each raise
* **Timeframe:** At this rate, including bonus and raise, she will max out around August
* **True-Up:** If she maxes out early, she will receive a true-up for the periods she did not contribute to the 401k, sometime in the middle of the following calendar year, *provided she stays until December 31st of the current (contributing) year*

***My Plan***

* **Contributions:** Dollar for dollar 5%, but effective January 2022 going to match 8% if employee contributes 6%. I put in 16% and bump by 1% each raise
* **Timeframe:** At this rate, including bonus and raise, I will max out around November
* **True-Up:** If I max out early, I will receive a true-up for the periods I did not contribute to the 401k, in the middle of the following calendar year, *no matter if/when I leave*. If I put in >6% of my salary by any point in the current/contributing year (which this year's max of $19,500 is well above), then I will receive the true-up for un-matched time periods no matter what

In both cases, we love our jobs/companies, and are not planning on leaving, all else equal. Also, assume whatever increase occurs in take-home gets invested into a taxable account.

**My question to you:** do I spread our contributions across the year as best we can, and invest the rest into taxable (since doing so would increase our take-home pay)? I can see wanting to make sure I hit my 6% as soon as possible since I'm guaranteed the true-up next year, if I leave at some point between maxing out and the year-end.

OTOH, in her case I can see wanting to delay when she's maxed-out, because if she leaves after maxing out but before year-end, she misses out on any match.

Thus, I could make a case to swap our contribution percentages: instead of me 16% and her 20%, put me at 20% and her at 16%, while keeping our take-home pays similar.

Right? Thoughts? Am I leaving out any key information? And what am I not thinking of? Who am I?","self","https://redd.it/m61sdu"

Though I don't post or comment much, I have been a part of this community since \~2013 and like many who commented on his post, have always been surprised at the lack of MBAs success stories shared here. That being said, I will qualify by saying that in my view, there is a HUGE difference on ROI between a top \~15 MBA and everything else. I'd argue that unless it is being paid for by someone else, the latter is almost never worth it.

Nevertheless, I acknowledge I've been fairly lucky - I think it would be difficult to replicate my path exactly, but there may be useful tidbits here for the broader community.

[My net worth trajectory.](https://imgur.com/a/Z0CDmWJ)

**My Background**

I graduated undergrad in 2008 with a finance degree from a good, but not great private school (top \~50), with \~$100k in student loans. I managed to land a middle-office job at a global financial services firm despite their not recruiting very actively from my school, only to to lose the offer before I started as the financial crisis worsened.

I spent the next year unsuccessfully looking for \*any\* financial services job, before ultimately deciding to join the military as an officer in 2009. My rationale for that decision was threefold: 1) the military has a fairly robust student debt repayment program (they ended up paying off \~2/3rd of the $100k mentioned above in exchange for a 3 year commitment), 2) top MBA programs love to recruit veterans, so I reasoned I might be able to attend one of those after a few years and make my way back to finance and 3) if I stuck around after my initial 3 year commitment I would start accruing time towards the post-9/11 GI Bill, which would help pay for that same MBA.

My experience in the military is probably worth its own post, but overall I found it to be a very positive experience. I learned a lot about leadership, had experiences I will always remember and look back fondly on the sense of camaraderie. The negatives are largely obvious, but I ended up doing two fairly dangerous combat deployments, spent a lot of time away from my family, and it is not an exaggeration to say you give up a significant amount of control over your life.

Having studied finance, I understood the importance of saving for retirement, but I'd say overall I made middling progress on that front as I whittled away the part of my student loans the military didn't repay.

**MBA**

I applied and was accepted into a top MBA program in 2014. As I mentioned, these programs tend to value military service very highly, though I did also score relatively well on the GMAT (\~90th percentile). That being said, I did meet one or two other veterans who managed to get in with much worse scores (50-60th percentile).

The two years I served in the military beyond my initial 3 year commitment qualified me for a partial benefit under the GI Bill. They ended up giving me \~$20k per year (\~$40k total), as well as a fairly substantial monthly stipend which meant I didn't need to borrow for my living expenses. This went a long way towards covering the \~$200k cost of the degree.

On top of that, veterans are highly sought after by employers who hire MBAs (we count towards their diversity metrics). In fact, investment banks are so competitive for diverse talent that I was able to land a summer internship \*before\* I started business school, which came along with a $50k scholarship towards my first year of school. Combined with another $50k scholarship for my second year once I accepted their offer to return full-time, business school was essentially free (ended up borrowing \~$20k)

**Income & Net Worth Trajectory**

**2016**

I graduated with my MBA and started full-time as an investment banker. I received a signing bonus of \~$50k (in addition to the scholarships already mentioned) and a base salary of $125k. Though you can't make it out in the graph, my NW was around -$30k (mostly student loans for undergrad and a small amount for the MBA).

During this period, I maxed my retirement contributions but every other incremental dollar went towards wiping out the debt. I got married in 2015, but we didn't consolidate finances until 2018. In any case, she started her own MBA this year, so her income was zero until then.

**2017**

Salary increased to $150k and received a $35k stub bonus for the 6 months I worked in 2016. After factoring in NYC/NYS/Federal taxes I was able to increase my NW to \~$30k on spending of $60k (long hours meant I didn't have time to really spend). Wife had about $80k saved which she used to pay for her first year of school, but because our finances were still separate at this point neither the savings nor the spending are accounted for so far.

For the most part, I've invested everything outside of my retirement accounts through Betterment. I know they can be controversial here, but despite the fact I think I know more about modern portfolio theory than the average bear, I find outsourcing the job to them more efficient.

**2018**

Salary increases to $175k and bonus of $70k for my work in 2017. That bonus would be great in most other industries, but was not great for a second year investment banking associate. (Side note: the horror stories you hear about investment banking are largely true - I regularly worked 80+ hour weeks (record was 115 hours ) with fairly shitty people. I don't miss it). I started looking for another job and landed one in April.

New role is hard to describe without giving too much away, but is a mix of corporate development and private equity (NOT traditional PE like KKR, Apollo, etc.). Base salary remained at $175k and I received a stub bonus for April-December of $75k in cash + $75k in stock options vesting over 4 years (new company pays bonuses in December of the same year, while my previous company paid early the following year).

My wife and I finally consolidated our finances this year, which is part of the reason you see a big jump in NW to $380k - she had about $150k in retirement accounts. She finishes her MBA halfway through this year and starts a new role in marketing paying \~$110k. We use a combination of my year-end bonus, her signing bonus and her salary to pay off the debt she had for her second year of school. Outside of debt repayment, spending was \~$55k this year.

**2019**

I get a COLA raise this year and a bonus of $150k cash and $150k in equity. The company's stock price doesn't do so well, so despite vesting my options are essentially worthless. Wife also gets a COLA raise and a $10k bonus. We spend \~$50k this year, so between savings and market appreciation we are able to increase our NW to $680k, despite the brief downturn at the end of the year.

**2020**

I get another COLA raise and my bonus is flat vs. 2019 ($150k in cash and $150k in equity) due to the pandemic. The stock price finally begins to appreciate so I am able to exercise and sell some of my options throughout the year as they vest. Wife also gets a COLA raise and another $10k bonus. A combination of the birth of our first child, moving into a larger/nicer apartment, hiring a nanny and generally buying things to keep ourselves sane during lockdown (including a new car) result in a SIGNIFICANT increase in spending - we end up the year having spent \~$160k. Despite that, savings + market appreciation gets us to $1.4m, of which \~$400k is unvested stock options.

**2021**

I receive yet another COLA raise at the beginning of the year and my wife get's a promotion which comes with a 15% raise. Savings + market appreciation so far this year gets us to \~$1.5m, though \~$400k of that is still unvested stock options.

**Pursuing FIRE**

Though I've somewhat glossed over it, this has been a pretty difficult journey. While I was in the military I spent my time either deployed or living in small army towns in the middle of nowhere, where there isn't much to do. For years I saw my then girlfriend, now wife, once a month (assuming I was stateside) and my family and friends much less often than that.

The jobs I've had post-MBA have been pretty brutal. When I was a banker I regularly stayed in the office until 9pm, went home, had a drink (or three) and went to bed to do it all over again. I often spent a good chunk of my weekend in the office. My memories of vacations during those two years are of being on calls or updating Excel models and PowerPoints while my friends and family enjoyed themselves. My hours have gotten much better now, but I still have the sort of job you never really disconnect from. I don't mention this out of a desire for pity, but just want to be transparent about what the tradeoffs are in potentially accelerating your FIRE journey in this way.

I now have a soft target of $2.5m to FIRE, but I may try to reach for $5m. The path I've taken has without a doubt significantly accelerated my journey, though realistically, I don't think I have the stamina to do this sort of work for much more than 5 more years (which would make me 40), so if I haven't hit either of those numbers (seems unlikely, but who knows) I may try to FIRE anyway or at the very least switch to a MUCH lower stress role.

I hope this is helpful to some in terms of sharing a high-income alternative to the software engineer roles we usually see here. While I certainly got a big leg up by essentially not having to pay for business school, I'd still be >$1m in NW if I had started my post-MBA career with $200k in debt. I do think my income progression has been fairly strong, but it is not at all atypical or wildly unusual for those that choose to go into investment banking post-MBA.

As a kid, I always ate my vegetables first so that I could more fully enjoy the other (more delicious) parts of the meal without distraction. I guess I've approached FIRE the same way - cramming all of the stress and work into as short of a time as possible so that I can maximize my time retired. This might not be the best path for everyone, but it works for me. Cheers!","self","https://redd.it/m6dhuz"

First-time poster, couldn't find anything on this topic so I thought I would ask. How do you deal with investments for FIRE as a couple when there's a big age difference?

My husband (48) and I (32) are ready to start investing - we're looking into index funds and potentially indexed pension plans, with the idea of perhaps diversifying a bit more (a small % of portfolio into stocks, etc.) once we feel like we really know what we're doing.

\[Super-quick info on us: I work full time (part-time self-employed, part-time salaried), he is the househusband. No rent/mortgage, no debts; emergency fund is completed now. Live in Europe, so healthcare is not a problem (at least so far). However, we are disabled, so our earning potential & ""career"" lifespan is potentially shorter than that of most people, which is an important part of wanting to FIRE/securing our future (the main thing, of course, is wanting to do something more interesting with our lives \^\^). In theory, entitled to state pension from 65 on, but likely to be very small.\]

The thing is,  the age difference makes me wonder how to tackle certain things:

* Risk - they say you can have a riskier portfolio when you're young, and then from your 40s on, start moving into safer ground. What do you do when one's early 30s and the other is nearing 50\*?
* Returns over the long term - what would constitute long term here? (or for whom?)
* Ownership of investing accounts - is there any difference between having a single, joint account and having two independent accounts, one for each of us? (from purely an age point of view)
* Pension plans - if we could only put money towards one, which one would make the most sense?
* Anything else I might not have thought of yet? (like some kind of... tax implication in terms of official retirement for one and not the other?

Thanks a lot in advance and sorry if the answer is a DUH, OBVIOUS - we really worry about overlooking something and making some really stupid noob mistake, and at the same time, I'm great at overthinking to the point of nosebleed, so...

For the last couple years I have written a reflection on that particular year of FIRE along with new revelations. They both got some traction and seemed well liked so I thought I’d write the year 3 version… 

**My background:** I’m a scientist in my mid 40’s who got into the big data side of tech just as it took off. I worked for a few large companies, and a few small companies, both as an FTE and consultant. During one of my “no job, no consulting” periods in the late fall of 2013 (notoriously hard time to find a new job as everyone is on vacation, spent their budgets, etc.) I fell deep into the bitcoin rabbit hole researching what it was, what it might become etc. I bought in a few times and sold a majority of my holdings in December 2017 (not at the peak, but close) for about 1.5M. I had also saved a shit-ton of money over the years (almost 1M) because I never spent other than buying/fixing up my house. The FIRE idea was natural to me – I had an instinctual aversion to debt, simple tastes, and grew up without a lot (but didn’t feel like that was an issue). My job was not really going in a direction I liked, and I had just cashed over a million post-tax cryptobucks so I quit. I figured I’d try a self-imposed sabbatical of an undetermined length. With all my retirement, bank, and stock accounts bundled together, including house equity I had close to 4M. I never went back in any real way. Since retirement my entire portfolio has more than doubled to 8M.

**Warning:** This post is me navel-gazing about my so-far-quite-successful-post-retirement journey. Some people like this stuff. Some people think I’m pissing on them by boasting or humblebragging or whatever. I liked reading these posts before I FIRE’d so I am paying it back. I write these posts to tell a story, to inform, maybe even entertain. I say the following based on some salty comments I have received in the past - If my take on life triggers you, stop reading this now and go do something fun. Life is too short to be an asshole on the internet. Sermon concluded.


**Reflection 1: Last year was fucking insane on so many fronts.**

In no particular order: I bought a house with cash during a pandemic; I lost harvested $100k in a mutual fund that by the end of the year had regained all I had “lost”; my dad died; my partner’s dad died; the stock market dip of March wiped 20% of my net worth out (yes, it recovered);  I helped start a small company that got an unsolicited 2M acquisition offer 4 months after we launched (we declined); Trump almost got reelected.
So many ups and downs. So much jacked-up nervous system. Trust me – not having to worry about work and money was a blessing not lost on me. I thanked my lucky stars daily for that, but still found enough challenge in the rest of the bullshit thrown at me. Losing dad was a big one.  

**Reflection 2: I like being retired**

Specifically - I enjoy the control it gives me. Now that I am not worried about whether this whole “Retirement thing” is going to work from the economics angle (something I used to fret about a bit as I started this phase), I believe it will work for me mentally. It took a while, and when a friend offered me some work in year 2 of retirement, I jumped at the opportunity (and it also seemed super fun). Some of the work was fun, and some did not pan out. Last tax year I did not work for money a single day. I was offered a few jobs last year (it seems to be like that thing where when you are single but not looking, you get attention… same sort of situation) but none of them made sense for what I would have to give up. Let’s be honest – full time work cramps the hell out of your schedule! I did start a technology business with a foreign friend in the late summer, but we took no salary and it was a super part-time deal, had no legal existence, and existed at a virtual-garage level of legitimacy. Even so, we were approached by a software company and made an offer of 2M to merge with them (aqui-hire ish). We declined. 
So what do I do? I play in my workshop. I took up welding (art). I write essays. I read. I improve my land. I planted trees. After a huge storm recently smashed through our state, a friend had an incredible amount of debris in her yard, on her house and garage. It was trivial to spend a day helping her clean up her place – I just jumped in the truck and went. The openness of schedule is a fiercely guarded luxury of mine. Each night or morning I sketch out my day and then get to it…or get sidetracked or rerouted.

**Reflection 3: Last year I said “sometimes (4M) didn’t feel like enough” – I don’t feel like that any longer**

When my net worth dropped by 1M last March, I had a weird feeling in my stomach – oh fuck, is this the beginning of the end of my soon-to-be-fake-ass retirement? I took a deep breath and reminded myself that I had more after the drop than I had originally thought I needed to FIRE in the first place. I knew that recovery would happen (not sure when though), and I had plenty to float me through (emergency funds on hand too!) I could always go back to work if I was feeling poor. It didn’t help that I had just bought a house, outright. All that concern washed away as the market recovered reasonably quickly. Not only that, but over the past several months my remaining crypto assets have grown quite a bit. My net worth is now over 8M and just typing this seems surreal. I have no doubt now that 4M is enough. Some might ask “do you wish you had not sold the crypto back in 2017 now that it is worth so much more?” – Even though that 1M worth I sold would be worth 5M now, I’m happy with my decisions – look at my current net worth, which as I mentioned is enough AND I have not had to work for the last 3 years. That’s a pretty sweet deal that allowed me to tend to sick family members, emotionally support my mom after my dad passed, and other important experiences that would be diminished or impossible with a work schedule. 

**Reflection 4: Habits are a bitch! (busy in a bad way)**

Now that I am free of the economic tether, and fiercely guard control of my time, I only have myself to blame for what I do and don’t get done. I think I would like to be in better shape and be better at playing guitar, but my actions do not fit those ideas. I fall into habits (good and bad) that occupy time such that these areas do not get the attention I imagine they should. The point is that even though I am my own master, I can do better, and if I truly want these things (music, fitness) I am the only one to make that happen. One of my near-term goals is to figure out what it takes for me to get focused and remove less useful activities from my routines. Takeaway: being retired is not a substitute for discipline! Damnit!  

**Reflection 5: I still like a deal, but now it’s a dopamine hit instead of a survival tactic**

I grew up poor. I didn’t know anyone who was rich, or who knew how to manage money. As a kid/teen/adult with very little actual capital, I learned to be thrifty. I did not appreciate quality (I couldn’t afford to do so) and once I made a decent salary I learned the true cost of being poor. So now I seek quality where it makes sense, like in the food I eat and the tools I buy. But I also still love a deal, like a free library, or a pile of scrap wood for making art from. The thrill of the hunt is still with me, and I don’t mind spending the time instead of the money in pursuit of scarce goods. I’m not a spazz about it, churning credit cards or flipping out over double coupons (if those even still exist), but looking for used items when I don’t need something new, or browsing a rummage sale can still bring me great joy when I find a treasure. I’m not much of a collector or materialist, so it’s often utility that I am after (the furniture guy leaves hardwood scrap in his alley for people to take?!?!? I’m ON THAT). I also hate seeing things thrown away that still have life in them. We are such a wasteful culture. 

**Reflection 6: I now want to learn how to make my capital work, to create a funding mechanism for charity. I believe this may become my next “job”**
Every month I run my finances to see where I am at. As the last year came to an end, and my net worth kept creeping up, I realized that there was a new idea forming in my mind – what if I could figure a way to use capital I have to make additional capital that I then deploy in my community? Not particularly mind blowing, I know, but work with me… I was never in a position where I thought this was possible _for me_. When I had less money, I felt I needed to guard it to be sure I wouldn’t get sucked back into the old life. Giving it away in any large quantity was not on the radar. Now that it keeps growing I could begin to give it away – except that (lump sum giving) does not seem quite right. But what if I could manage a set of funds in a way that grew them in order to break off a piece of that and deploy it in my community in a very direct way (over and over)? I’m working on this concept now, and it inspires me to do some (potentially) more “traditional work” whereas before I was running from such a thing due to not needing it. It’s as if because I am now comfortable with where I am, I can potentially focus more efforts outwards. I’m still trying to figure out what this means for me.

…

I guess that’s enough for now. My relationship with money has evolved quite a bit, but I believe I am still humble, thankful, and respectful of those not in my position. Not being a flashy person, I don’t think you’d ever know my story just looking at me or how I act. There is no reason for me to be any other way. 

For you readers, I hope everyone has found ways to keep their journey going, even through the difficult times the last several months have presented. The other side has its own challenges for sure, and in some ways you trade one set of responsibilities for another, but for me – so far it ain’t so bad. 

Hope you enjoyed reading my (updated) story. I’m happy to answer questions if you have them.","self","https://redd.it/m6h8r8"

so im one of those many who are working real hard in investing/saving into my dividend portfolio. Ive started end of 2019 and now have \~$6600 annual dividends coming according to (trackyourdividends.com, iOS apps: DivCalc, Stock Events and DivTracker - i use multiple just to make sure its not far off).

Any ways, my goal is to move back to Japan/tokyo hopefully in 7 - 10 years. with my current strategy this should work and bringing in \~$70 - 90K dividends annually by then. (Wife (26) and I(29) work and make $191K together right now but i know we will make more due to the nature of our job/industry). We put in $2 - 3k monthly in our dividends portfolio and will increase more as we get paid out more.

If you are someone who have accomplish this and currently living off dividends, what is it like? Are you scared that your dividend pay out may cut off/slashed? When you are looking for a place to live like an apartment renting hunting, do brokers/real estate agent care how you are getting money? Im sure living off from dividend is still not well known so im not sure if brokers would take me seriously if i were to move to japan and show them that i get paid out ~$70 - 90K dividend annually.

Any stories/experiences would help.

thank you!

Edit: also I will keep reinvesting my money. I don’t think I will be using my whole $70-90k a year, I will use 10 -25% of that to reinvest in my dividend stocks.","self","https://redd.it/m6ikr1"

I am sharing this information here because I rather not talk about it with family and friends for obvious reasons.

To be specific about the reason for the delay, SO and I are holders of the MM2H (Malaysia My Second Home) retirement VISA that we applied for a few years ago. Our plan is to retire and settle in the island of Penang, which is the second largest urban center in Malaysia and about 4 hours drive from Kuala Lumpur. However, because of COVID, any non-citizen trying to go in has to file a lot of paperwork and subject themselves to an expensive and very strict 14 day quarantine in a government designated hotel, and you cannot leave your room for any reason during these 14 days. Plus, as of right now, everyone in Malaysia is under severe movement restrictions. Because of that, I've decide that there is little benefit leaving right now and that we'll be better off keeping the status quo, collecting a steady paycheck and pulling the plug once the situation becomes a little more normal. We hope that with vaccines rolling out worldwide, things should be somewhat close to normal by the end of the year. If that assumption holds, I will be quitting my job then.  Before you ask: Yes, we have been to Malaysia. Several times, actually. So we know what we are getting into.

A little bit about ourselves.

\- SO and I are in our early 40s, with no dependents. We both immigrated to the US when we were teens and met at a local 3rd tier, accepts almost anyone, state university that you probably never heard of.

\- I work for a FAANG, but on the marketing side. SO stays at home. Total annual compensation is around $400K (salary + bonus + equity). We current live in a VHCOL area.

\- We rented our entire lives and plan on continue to do so after retirement. We have no real estate investments and no plans on acquiring any real estate in the future. Nothing against it, just not our thing.

\- $4M total in assets, mostly in VTSAX and VTIAX. About $3M in a taxable account and the rest in a 401K and Roth IRA.

\- Did not invest a single dime in crypto. Ever. I understand blockchain and its benefits, but I do not understand the value of cryptocurrencies as investment vehicle. Maybe I just too old and stupid to grasp it. But I congratulate everyone who got on the bandwagon early and made it big. You saw something I could not and still can't, so kudos to you.

We plan on living on \~$45K year in Malaysia. This would get us a luxury condo by the beach, platinum health coverage, plus a quite comfortable overall lifestyle with 1Gbs fiber home internet, generous groceries, budget to eat out, go to events, and the occasional travel.

Running the numbers, I think I might be able to live off dividends, even though that was not the original plan. We were originally planning a 3% SWR, but after visiting Malaysia, we realized that this might be overkill. The dividends alone from our Vanguard funds should be more than enough to finance our lifestyle. This will also means that I will not need to worry about the ups and downs of the stock market, which I find to be quite liberating.

To be clear, I am NOT advocating for a dividend investment strategy and we never adopted one ourselves. I only pointing out that for our particular case, we came to the realization later in the journey that dividends might be enough to pay for our needs.

&#x200B;

Happy to answer any questions, but will refrain from sharing any details that might help identify us.

He wrote a lot less frequently, and never had any ads or recommended products; simply good, long-form, very introspective thoughts on FI and life.

He's barely posted since he retired in 2015, and today is the first time he's posted in 5 years.  The intervening 5 years have covered the happiest year of his life, the worst year of his life, health issues, divorce, and a return to work.

It's interesting, sobering, and worth the (long) read.  There's a lot to unpack, and it speaks a LOT to the things discussed on this sub constantly:  What will I do with my time after I retire?  How do I find purpose without work?  How do medical issues affect the best-laid plans?  Is going back to work 'giving up'?  Will being retired make you happy?

I hope this doesn't run afoul of any 'promotion' rules here: I have no affiliation with him, and he has no ads or products; I think this is a fantastic post to foster communication, and it is a very in-depth look at things that get discussed every day in this sub.

I read a comment somewhere mention all the great calculators in the sidebar, but I couldn't find the ones mentioned. I eventually figured out that the redesign only has 3 calculators while the classic version has more. The list of blogs and even the proto-FAQ is also helpful.

Perhaps this is something that could be remedied for all the new reddit users who I think get the redesigned view by default. This could be one reason why there's so many noob questions (of which I am one).

I was especially looking for the calculators and noticed that the even the list on the classic site could be updated because there's some other great ones out there. Maybe other users can add their fav tools or other resources to this comment thread and the mods could add to both sidebars (classic and new).

I think it's a lot easier to FIRE without kids, as kids can be very expensive, of course.  However, one of the greatest joys of my life was to experience the very basic human emotion of becoming a parent, and lovingly raising a tiny little baby to a mature adult.

It wasn't easy, it wasn't always fun, but it is amazing to experience such a fundamental life experience that really can't be measured in money or years of early retirement without kids.

My youngest kid is about to embark on college, which is going to be exciting and terrifying.  We are still in our 40's, but I can't believe we have hit such a major milestone.

I think I would have missed out a lot, if we had decided not to have kids, and just FIRE early in our 30's or 40's.

Even having successfully raised kids, and having my wife stay at home for most of that time, our net worth allows us to coastFIRE if we want, this year or next year.

However, I genuinely enjoy my job and career, so I don't see myself retiring any time soon.  I would miss the social circle of truly exceptionally smart people, if I were to quit working.  I have grown / matured so much by working with exceptionally good people, that if I had FIREd in my 30's, I would probably be far less of a mature person than I am today.

I am glad to be in a situation to FIRE if need be, but so glad we spent our ""money"" on raising kids, and allowing me to continue to grow as a person in my career, than to jettison early in my 30's / 40's and basically stagnate in early FIRE for the rest of my life.

EDIT: stream of consciousness thoughts - another huge aspect of health in life is the amount of social network you have and keep as you age.  Having kids gives you a greater social circle, one that can become far more important as you get into your later years.

I have an elderly neighbor that has been retired for a while, lost her partner, no kids.  All she does all day is basically play computer games, watch TV, make a few meals, and rinse / repeat every day.  It's  lonely existence, and we try to engage with her socially weekly.

Having work is also a great stabilizer for social health.  We have a social network of peers who are working towards the same goal, so we have social structure that can help keep our minds engaged and healthier.  When we FIRE and leave formal work like this, it's hard to replace that social structure to keep our brain active and engaged in that aspect, which can lead to some mental decline over long periods of time.  This is another reason I plan to never RE 100%, but maybe work 50-60% of FTE work so I can maintain that social network and structure.","self","https://redd.it/m7ktn5"
