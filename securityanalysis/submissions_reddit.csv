Hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.

My   name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About   two years ago, I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm   and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and   privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique   perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a   new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to   help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market   today.

I’m a long-term investor. I   am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long  time.  I’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and  everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led  me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed.  If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the  book  “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.

**Introduction**

I’m   excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month,  Smartsheet.  I’m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock  screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth),  scan Twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to  observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends  and family. One  of the best investment decisions I’ve made to date came  after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf  course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said, you  never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.

In   the case of Smartsheet, I became aware of the company through a stock   screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B),  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a  subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts,  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet,  the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I’ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, I’ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more  later in the  write up.

Another  positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was  watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader, the CEO of  Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word “Smartsheet” mentioned in  the video and  said “Are they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue  check mark?”. I  had to Google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it.  She said “My  company just transitioned all of our work onto  Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  Smartsheet.

**The Thesis Statement**

For   every stock pick I make, I want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you’re holding this position.

The thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:

*“Smartsheet:   A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.”*

I  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet’s website and look at the  “About” page, you will  find their “About” statement which says  “Smartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.”  Notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.

In   my thesis statement, I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM   software space. But how do I know this? Well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, UI/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. As you can see, Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. Let’s use our common sense for a second. At   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the   answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies   on the list. Let’s break them down 1 by 1:

* Workfront   was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront,  you’d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn’t  be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.
* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)
* Wrike is private
* ServiceNow   – CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing   here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also, the company  is  already quite large ($106B market cap)
* Asana   is public but just IPO’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don’t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   Furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the CWM space, they’re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in   several of Forrester’s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?
* Monday.com is private
* Microsoft – CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.
* Atlassian   – This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) They’re ranked way beneath  Smartsheet.  2) They’re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58B).

Now   that we’ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space  and  that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let’s understand why this is important. Other  than the  obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?

Well,   let’s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader, Smartsheet CEO,  during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th,  2020:

“Leaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.”

Key word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:

Asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.

Synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.

Any   communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. As   part of my research on Smartsheet, I read an E-Book that was written by   the original co-founders of Smartsheet, Mark Mader the current CEO and   Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is   called “The Power of Done”. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This   is a quote from their E-Book:

“According   to Basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.”

They   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded Smartsheet.

**How Smartsheet makes money**

At   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book, 100 Baggers, that  I  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This  isn’t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if I am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things I  look at.

Before I  talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet, I want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result, we now have  Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and Gantt  view.

The  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they’re hired to do – get work done. Think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they’re at with their assignments.  What if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  That’s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.

For   Smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. As I  mentioned  earlier, they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company.  Whenever you  see SaaS, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that’s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.

Smartsheet’s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   Smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses   Smartsheet.  For subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.

Smartsheet   offers four subscription levels: Individual, Business, Enterprise, and   Premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   Customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.

The   Connectors part of the business is something I find really  interesting.  Basically, Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet  user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true “command  center”  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. You’ll see this on the link above but some products  that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud,  Microsoft  Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Jira Software, Slack, and Skype  just to name a  few.

I think that  being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the  Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as “Smartsheet  competitors” actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can  be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral  angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to  their perceived “competitors”  reminds me a little bit of how Roku  (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on  their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies  like Adobe, Jira, Salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn’t allow for their  products to be integrated with  Smartsheet.

On  top of the  Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell,  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. For example, in May 2019, Smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. The name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.

Also,   in September 2020, Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder, Inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining  Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This  goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company’s marketing team was “really excited  about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” She told me  that before Smartsheet, her company’s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint.  Now, all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The  acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand  out in this department.

Nobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet’s   FY21 Engage Customer Conference, Anna Griffin, Smartsheet Chief   Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B   for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company’s brand. Sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and R&D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get  really difficult for  the company’s Marketing/Branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I  think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.

As   you can see, Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  CWM platform, the Connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that,  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  Traditionally, companies need to engage their IT  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an IT department employee who  doesn’t even do the job  that the app is being built for. Also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.

Here   is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet   customer, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): “I have been waiting for a solution like   WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,” said Hina Patel, Director of Sales   Operations at Cisco. “The ability to take our Smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.” As you can  see, the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.

Lastly,  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the  most recent  quarter, Q3 FY21, Professional Services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:

Subscription revenue = $90,890M for 91.8% of total revenue

Professional services revenue = $8,043M for 8.2% of total revenue

The main business of Yorkey is in the manufacturing and sales of plastic and metallic parts and components of Digital Still Cameras (DSCs), action cameras, copier-based multifunction peripherals, surveillance cameras, projectors and advanced TVs, etc.

The DSC market is a slowly dying business as mobile phones cameras become more advanced but Yorkey has managed to remain barely profitable with interest income mainly from property they own. The company derives a bulk of their revenues from Japan and the PRC. 

Yorkey’s latest interim report gives us reason to look at this stock. 

**Interim Report - Balance Sheet** **30/6/20 (All figures in USD$)**

**Non-current Assets**

Investment Properties: Acquired in 31 December 2016, Workshops 01-09. 26th Floor CRE Centre, bought for $6.3M. Unable to find any disclosed transactions at Cre centre and hence couldn’t get a gauge on whether they overpaid for this. 

However, let’s assume they overpaid and value this at = **$2.75M (50%)**

Property, Plant & Equipment: This is currently valued at US$5.1M on their balance sheet. As the DSC market is a slowly dying industry, let’s assume a worst case scenario and value their equipment at **$750K (15%).**

Deposits valued at balance sheet figures = **$390K**

**Total Non-current Assets = $4M**

**Current Assets**

Inventories ($2.7M) = Let’s assume their inventories are worthless and value it at **$270K (10%).** 

Trade and other Receivables ($7.76M) = **$6M(valued at 80%)**

Bank balances and cash = **$82M**

**Total Current Assets = $88M**

**Total Assets = $4M + $88M = $92M**

**Yorkey has no debt and total liabilities amount to** = **$20M** 

Thus, anyone can come along and pay **$56M** for a company with a book value of about **$72M in a worst case scenario** and get $16M for free. 

Let’s say in the past 3 months since the interim report was released, the company has suffered more losses in their business. I believe the difference between book value and market price provides a sufficient margin of safety as I have been fairly pessimistic in the valuation of the assets.

**Short Case:**

1. Market might know something I don’t, resulting in the low share price.
2. The numbers could have been fudged and the business is in worse condition. Management might be not be disclosing all information to shareholders. (This has happened before in 2013 but the old CEO and financial controller have been removed) 

**Catalysts:**

1. Yorkey Optical is a dying business, but the DSC market has slightly recovered and Yorkey’s business will recover over the coming years. I believe Yorkey will not go bankrupt anytime soon and will still be definitely be worth more than $56M. ([http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/dw-202011\_e.pdf](http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/dw-202011_e.pdf)) ([http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/d-202011\_e.pdf](http://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/d-202011_e.pdf))
2. Management has also been buying back shares. 

**Additional points:**

David Webb, HK corp governance guru has also recently added US$35K to his current holdings. He is a 5% shareholder of the company since 2013 and has fought against the board for them to be more shareholder-friendly.

The past 3 times he has invested a similar amount to his positions, the stock has always revalued upwards in the following months.

3. One sector driving the bulk of market performance (e.g. Tech in 1999, Property in 2007, Tech in 2020)

I would love some feedback and a discussion on your thoughts on it. 

**The Situation and Company Background**

Affirm is a leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) provider that allows consumers to have the flexibility to pay for their purchase over a period of 6 weeks to 48 months with merchants that have added Affirm as a payment option. The company is expected to trade under the ticker “AFRM” and start trading next Wednesday with price talk around $38/share, which equates to an equity value of around $9.2B. This is a severely lower valuation than other fintech peers such as Afterpay, Square, and Shopify. We believe that AFRM should be valued at least $20B to $30B using a conservative FY23 EV/Sales total company comp of 13x compared to Afterpay at 18.3x, SHOP at 28.1x, and Visa and Mastercard around 16x. 

The company mainly operates in the United States, and as of September 30th, has already partnered with over 6,500 merchants and has 3.9M active consumers but recently acquired PayBright, a Canadian based BNPL provider. Affirm generates most of their revenue through fees charged to merchants when a customer uses the BNPL option at checkout. Additionally, the company generates revenue through simple interest charged to consumers that have chosen to extend their payment options beyond the interest-free payment length. Merchant fees range from 2 – 3% while APR ranges from 0 – 30%. Additionally, the company earns fees through customers who utilize a virtual debit card, gains on loans sold to third-party investors, and servicing fees on loans managed by Affirm. 

In FY20 (June end), Affirm saw +92.7% revenue growth to $509.5M, with $256.8M in merchant network revenue (50.4% of revenue) and $186.7M in interest income (36.6% of revenue). Additionally, active customers grew +76.9% to 3.62M active users and gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew +77.0% to $4.6B. We note that Affirm is currently reliant on one merchant, Peloton (PTON) for their revenue as the partner accounted for 28% of FY20 revenue and the top 10 merchants accounted for 35% of revenue. 

**Investment Thesis**

We believe that Affirm will be the dominant BNPL provider in the future in the United States that will benefit from increasing usage of BNPL at checkout. We anticipate Affirm’s recent partnerships with e-commerce platform Shopify (SHOP) and payment company Adyen (ADYEN.AS) will help drive a flywheel effect to allow Affirm to establish itself as the dominant BNPL provider in the United States as both platforms will help bring additional merchants and consumers onto the platform. We expect the Shopify partnership to help capture a differentiated market that is underserved compared to competitors Afterpay and Klarna. With the addition of Shopify, hundreds of thousands of vendors can now add a BNPL option seamlessly which will allow Affirm take market share, which will further drive the flywheel effect. 

We also believe that Affirm provides a better product suite than competitors from the perspective of both the merchant and consumer. Affirm’s product provides more flexibility on payment term length compared to its competitors, offers virtual debit cards to allow consumers to use Affirm at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm, and a no fee and competitive high-yield savings account. Additionally, Affirm charges substantially lower merchant fees. Together, we believe merchants are more likely to choose Affirm when deciding on which BNPL company to implement, which will further compound the desirability of implementing Affirm as their consumer and merchant base grows.  

Finally, we anticipate Affirm to serve a Millennial, Gen Z, and Gen X population that has not adopted credit card usage like their older generations. Their generations are more accustomed to online shopping and utilizing digital payments but have built a distrust in traditional credit due to seeing their older friends and family negatively impacted during the 2008 financial crisis.

**Comparable Company Analysis and Valuation**

[Comp Sheet](https://imgur.com/CLgDfsK) Source: Factset, and [Valuation](https://imgur.com/UM5iiOS) indicate a fair value of $20B to $30B equity value compared to IPO pricing of around $9.2B. This is another severely underpriced IPO that is poised to pop on the first day of trading. 

**Buy Now Pay Later Background**
Affirm offers a new alternative way that people can transact. Consumers have been utilizing different methods to trade for goods and services since the dawn of man. Transactions have originally started through bartering for different items and goods and evolved into using coins made from precious metals as accepted methods of payment. In a more modern world, we have moved to utilizing paper currency and coinage, and more recently, into credit/debit and digital wallets. The way people shop has also significantly evolved throughout time. Gone are the days merchants carried their wares across different towns. Although we still have outdoor markets much like Greek agoras in 1,000 B.C., we have evolved in the way we pay for goods and services at markets. Local stores and department stores, which dominated the way consumers shopped in the 19th and 20th century, are in a decline. Now, we are entering a new period in how consumers shop; online. With this revolution, we can see continued shifts and advancement in the way people pay and we believe the “buy now pay later” option is the innovation that has the potential to upend the traditional credit/debit card market.

Affirm will become the second largest publicly traded BNPL provider, behind Australia’s Afterpay. The BNPL payment option is an alternative way for a consumer to pay for product by providing flexibility regarding payment terms and is a point-of-sale (POS) loan.  Although the BNPL payment method is still miniscule compared to traditional payment methods such as credit and debit cards, accounting for approximately 1% of e-comm sales in 2019, Worldpay’s 2020 Global Payments report expects penetration to increase 3x to 3% of e-comm sales utilizing BNPL by 2023. In EMEA, the payment method is already more established and accounted for 6% of 2019 e-comm payments and Worldpay expects it to reach ~10% penetration by 2023. Market research company eMarketer estimated that U.S. consumers spent $590B on e-comm in 2019. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the first 3 quarters of 2020 had 16.3% of retail sales ex-auto penetration through e-comm, compared to 12.5% in the same period LY, and e-comm dollars spent grew +34.2%. With the pandemic reshaping how consumers shop and accelerating the growth of e-comm sales usage and spending, we believe that BNPL usage could potentially beat Worldpay’s estimates. 

Another key piece for Affirm’s success relates to their credit risk model. Unlike a traditional credit card where a consumer is approved for a credit limit at the time of application, Affirm provides a credit limit in addition to analyzing risk at the transaction level and can approve/reject purchases at the time of purchase. The company’s risk model has allowed them to approve 20% more customers compared to other competitors while still limiting delinquency and default rates. Additionally, their 36-month delinquency rate is more than 50% lower than the credit card industry average of 2.5%, with a rate of 1.1%. We also estimate that AFRM’s net charge-off rates are also about 50% lower than industry average, ending FY20 with 1.8% of loans charged off compared to the credit card industry average of 3.7% in the same period. Although traditional credit card companies can lower a consumer’s credit limit at any point in time, they are often slow to react as their algorithms rely on antiquated methods such as credit scores, transaction history, and credit usage. This indicates credit card algorithms are utilizing data that could be older than a month to make credit risk decision. Affirm’s proprietary risk model has brought the credit risk model into modern times with real-time economic data in addition to SKU level data to assess risk more advantageously and at a transactional level.

**Why Affirm?**

Although Affirm is not the only BNPL provider in the U.S. and was not the first provider, we believe that Affirm’s product suite is superior compared to competitors such as Afterpay and Klarna. Currently, Afterpay only lets consumers split their purchase into 4 interest free payments split in 2-week intervals across 4 payments, spreading payments across 6-weeks. Klarna’s product is essentially identical. Affirm allows consumers to split their purchases monthly for up to 48 months, with most interest free periods ranging up to 12 months. Additionally, we believe Affirm is more compelling for the retailer to utilize because the merchant fees charged are substantially lower (2 – 3%) vs. Afterpay (3 – 6%) and Klarna (up to 5.99%). Affirm also offers a virtual debit card, which lets you use your Affirm account to pay at retailers that have not currently partnered with Affirm as their chosen BNPL provider.

**How Can Affirm Continue to Grow and Improve?**

Affirm is Still Missing Multiple Pieces to Become the Dominant BNPL Provider. Although we are bullish on Affirm’s long-term prospects and impressed with their current progress, we believe there is still room to improve. We believe two key components of a dominating alternative payment company are still missing, and once implemented, can accelerate new user adoption. (1) Affirm needs to implement a rewards program, similar to traditional credit cards and Klarna’s “Vibe” rewards program. Affirm highlighted most of their users have the ability to pay for their purchase in full but prefer the financial flexibility of splitting payments. We believe Affirm’s users are financially responsible consumers and may face hesitation to utilize the BNPL option vs. a credit card as there is no rewards/cash back offering at Affirm. We expect Affirm to offer a rewards program in the near future, which would impact profitability, but would help drive customer acquisition in the long-term. (2) A physical card that allows the user to utilize Affirm’s BNPL option in retail stores could help drive additional GMV growth. The card would be programmed to follow the merchant’s current agreement and timeframe of repayment that the merchant and Affirm have already agreed too. However, if the card is used at a non-partner merchant, AFRM would allow the card to be used as a 0% APR credit card with repayment term lengths determined by their proprietary credit risk model. Recall that a credit card was used to pay in 40% of in-store transactions, and we believe a physical card can help complete AFRM’s product suite. We also believe the card can help bring Affirm on equal footing with competitors that have partnered with substantially more merchants as consumers can use the Affirm card online with any merchant.

**The Bears**

Affirm is in a distant third place with 3.9M active users in the U.S. as of September 30, 2020, trailing Afterpay’s 6.5M active U.S. customers and Klarna’s 10M customers in the same period. Additionally, Affirm currently has 6.5k active U.S. merchant partnerships compared to Afterpay’s 13.9k U.S. partnerships and Klarna’s 235k+ global partners. Lastly, Affirm lags both competitors in GMV. Affirm saw $5.3B in TTM GMV compared to Afterpay’s $11.1B AUD and Klarna’s $35B+ USD from January to September 2020.  We do highlight that Affirm is the leader in average GMV/customer at $1,359 compared to Afterpay at $991 and Klarna at $412, which we believe is due to high exposure to PTON and other higher-AOV retailers.

Affirm is still heavily reliant on Peloton (PTON), but we believe they have a symbiotic relationship. PTON offers Affirm as an option to finance equipment at 0% APR for up to 39 months. Our field checks and PTON’s 10-K indicate that substantial portion of PTON equipment purchases are financed through AFRM. AFRM also disclosed that 28% of FY20 revenue came from their PTON partnership. A big critique of AFRM’s business model is that they are too reliant on one merchant for their revenue. We believe that this could pose a risk in the intermediate future, but analysts expect PTON’s performance through FY2021 (June 30-end) to remain strong. PTON recently reported an explosive 1Q (Sept-30 end) with +233% revenue growth but +281% growth in their connected fitness segment, which is the segment that recognizes sales of their Peloton Bike.

**Still Undervalued Excluding PTON**
[Still valued at $22B excluding PTON revenue](https://imgur.com/M5aoT3p) Source: My estimates from backing out PTON revenue contribution

**Valuation**

We use a blended valuation to arrive to a $94 implied value/share, which provides +147% upside to the high end of the IPO price talk of $33 to $38/share. Our valuation is based on a 75%/25% blend of a multiples-based analysis on FY2023E and a DCF model. Our EV/sales analysis assigns a 16x multiple on merchant network revenue, 12x multiple on interest income revenue, and a 2x multiple on servicing income, virtual card revenue, and gain on sale of loans. This provides a total company EV/sales multiple of 13x FY23 estimates. This is lower than APT’s 18.3x FY23 EV/sales multiple, which we believe is justified due to AFRM’s revenue mix that is more concentrated towards interest income revenue, lower GMV, fewer active customers, and high reliance on one merchant. However, AFRM is a fast-growing alternative payment company that is growing share in a fast-growing industry, has strong partnerships that we believe will help drive growth long-term, and a strong leadership team with successful experience in the internet/payment space. For DCF, we use a WACC of 10.9%.

[Finally, a more conservative sensitivity table indicates ~$73 valuation with a very conservative EV/sales multiple and lower 3-year CAGR assumption.](https://imgur.com/4FAtFHA) Source: My estimates

A lot of the software companies on the market today look incredibly expensive when viewed through a value lens and analysed using value metrics such as P/E ratio, price-to book etc.

But these companies are generally performing very well.

One of the problems, in my opinion, is related to how we think about profitability for high-growth subscription businesses. In a ‘value’ world, the more earnings/profit in a given year the better. However, with SaaS companies, it's the total profit over the lifetime of the company that matters. In SaaS, the majority of the revenue gained from an individual customer will come in the future, not at the point of customer acquisition/initial sale. Therefore, a SaaS company that is currently highly profitable is a company that can’t find good opportunities to efficiently acquire any more customers. If they could, they would be spending that money on sales & marketing since every dollar spent acquiring a customer would create well over a dollar in cash flow over the lifetime of that customer.

So, if standard value metrics don't work for high-growth SaaS companies, what does?

Are there any metrics that you use to analyse these companies that you think are particularly insightful???

One metric that i've found to be very useful is the Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth metric.

# Enterprise Value/Sales/Growth

Enterprise Value/Sales is one of the most common metrics you will see used to value high-growth tech companies. However, it misses the main reason that tech companies get such high valuations in the first place - their growth rates.

If you have two companies both valued at 50 times sales but one company is growing 60% per year while the other is only growing 20% per year, then you are looking at two very different companies.

When looking at the price of a tech company relative to its sales, it is critical to also look at its growth rate. This is where the EV/S/G metric is so useful.

The formula is as follows:

**(Enterprise Value/Revenue) / Revenue Growth Rate**

The closer to zero that a company gets on this metric the better. Companies with a score of over one are not doing as well and are not growing fast enough to justify their high valuations.

Let’s look at Zoom as an example (revenue and revenue growth are for the last 12 months):

**($104.36B / $1.96B) / 262.3% = 53.2 / 262.3**

**= EV/S/G of 0.2**

So you can see that even though Zoom is valued at 63 times sales, because of it’s exceptional growth rate over the last 12 months, it actually has an incredibly strong EV/S/G ratio. If it can keep up its exceptional growth rate (granted, that is a big IF), Zoom is actually undervalued relative to many other SaaS companies.

A company on the other end of the scale with a far less healthy EV/S/G ratio is Bill.com.

Bill.com has a relatively similar EV/S ratio to Zoom of 62.6. However, they 'only' grew 39.24% over the last 12 months. They have an EV/S/G score of 1.6 which is far worse than Zoom’s 0.2.

**EV/S/G for popular tech companies:**

Here is the EV/S/G score for 6 of the most popular high-growth tech companies, ranked from best to worst.

1. Twilio = 0.58
2. Crowdstrike = 0.68
3. Datadog = 0.69
4. Docusign = 0.72
5. Shopify = 0.74
6. Okta = 0.94

I'm trying to put together a list of the best metrics to analyse and compare these companies, so please let me know if there are others that you find useful. Would love to hear them

// Seth Klarman, the founder of hedge fund Baupost Group, has told clients central bank policies and government stimulus have convinced investors that risk “has simply vanished”, leaving the market unable to fulfil its role as a price discovery mechanism.

The private letter to investors in his fund, which was seen by the Financial Times, amounts to a damning critique of recent market behaviour by one of the world’s foremost value investors.

Mr Klarman criticised the Federal Reserve for slashing rates and flooding the financial system with money since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that the central bank’s moves have made it difficult to gauge the health of the US economy.

“With so much stimulus being deployed, trying to figure out if the economy is in recession is like trying to assess if you had a fever after you just took a large dose of aspirin,” he wrote. “But as with frogs in water that is slowly being heated to a boil, investors are being conditioned not to recognise the danger.”

The biggest problem with these unprecedented and sustained government and central bank interventions is that risks to capital become masked even as they mount

US stocks are up more than 75 per cent since their low in March, while spreads on corporate debt — a measure of how much extra interest corporate borrowers have to pay compared to the US government — returned to pre-Covid levels this month.

Mr Klarman — who founded Boston-based Baupost almost four decades ago and has grown it to $30bn in assets under management — underperformed the market in 2020.

He has been intensifying his criticisms of US central bank interventions for the past several months. In the latest quarterly letter, Mr Klarmen referred to the Fed as an “800-pound gorilla” that has priced out investors who typically provide liquidity in moments of distress.

“The biggest problem with these unprecedented and sustained government and central bank interventions is that risks to capital become masked even as they mount,” he said.

Mr Klarmen also said the Fed policies had exacerbated economic inequality, referring to a “K” shaped recovery that has seen “the fortunes of those already at the top bounding swiftly upward, while those at the bottom remain on a downslope without end”. 

Using Tesla as an example, Mr Klarman said shares in the “barely profitable” electric carmaker had soared “seemingly beyond all reason”, briefly making the company’s founder Elon Musk the richest person in the world. Low interest rates have made projected cash flows more valuable, he said, a point many investors have unwisely used to justify valuations on companies that sit far above historic norms.

“The more distant the eventual pay-off, the more the present value rises,” he wrote. “When it comes to the value of cash flows, the vast and limitless future, yet to unfold, has gained considerable ground on the more firmly anchored present.”

The Fed’s policies and programmes “have directly contributed to exceptionally benign market conditions where nearly everything is bid up while downside volatility is truncated”, he added. “The market’s usual role in price discovery has effectively been suspended.”

Mr Klarman said investors were now in a constant hunt for yield that was driving them to riskier corners of the markets, including investment grade corporate debt, private credit or junk bonds. 

The Fed’s drastic measures had helped to boost economic activity and rescue ailing businesses, Mr Klarmen said. “But they have also kindled two dangerous ideas: that fiscal deficits don’t matter, and that no matter how much debt is outstanding, we can effortlessly, safely, and reliably pile on more.” //","self","https://redd.it/l1snpi"

# Industry Overview

The biogas is released into the atmosphere with the decomposition of organic waste. This biogas (40-60% of methane and 60-40% of carbon dioxide and other gases) is generated by the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter can be turned into biomethane (95%+ methane) that can be used as a substitute for natural gas. This means that it prevents the release of methane (one of the greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere as well as CO2 making a carbon-neutral loop or even a carbon-negative loop. A big plus for this technology is that it uses the already available infrastructure to distribute gas, making it more viable economically.

This is not all perfect since the combustion of this gas is still pollution. This raises the question of how much this investment is worth it since the technology can be considered ""polluting"" in a decade. The risk of such a scenario is reduced since there is no way to reduce the pollution from farms, wastewater, and landfills, making it the only viable solution.

The main driver of this business is the regulatory changes that encourage this technology. The de-carbonization is one of the main drivers of this business since it is very difficult to actually reduce the emissions of CO2 in areas such as farms and landfills.

[The industry is projected to grow at around 15-20&#37; per year. ](https://preview.redd.it/u0du9u2o1pc61.png?width=1252&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4c727d1cecea9d8d35a0063a4cfb169f05de1b1)

# Business Description

The business operates in the Renewable Natural Gas sector. It designs, overlooks the production, installs, and services a range of biogas upgrading systems using its patented water wash technology as well as other proven industrial technologies.

The company uses an asset-light model, meaning they outsource all the production. In 2019, approximately 66% of the Greenlane Biogas Group’s suppliers were located in North America and approximately 31% were from suppliers in Europe. The exact suppliers and their weight to the company are not shown.

They use all 3 technologies to process the biogas: water wash (the main one); pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and membrane. This is one of the ways that they differentiate themselves since no one else offers all 3 technologies.

As mentioned before their main technology is water wash. It has a low amount of units installed and yet it is the second biggest technology when it comes to the overall installed capacity.

[Number os Units Installed](https://preview.redd.it/uisrr7tu1pc61.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=018cebfe89f25969b6c34136fc0f3be3dbbcb6ce)

&#x200B;

[Total Capacity](https://preview.redd.it/nf2txszv1pc61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=81358a056d14f4746ed37862bcdeaf86630fdf5f)

Companies' main assets are the people and the patterns that they have. This is both their advantage and disadvantage. On one side they can expand at a rapid pace since there are no assets limiting them and yet on the other hand these models present much risk since their business is focused on production.

# Company's History

The company was created in 1986 in New Zealand with a focus on designing and building heat exchangers and gas compression packages. In the 1990's they started to install the upgrading systems using water wash technology (their main technology).

In 2014 the company was acquired by Pressure Technologies and renamed to PT Biogas Holdings Limited.

By 2018, over 100 Greenlane Biogas branded biogas upgrading systems had been deployed into 18 countries.

In 2017 the company restructured, moving from three regionally managed units into one globally operated company headquartered in Vancouver, Canada by Brad Douville.

In 2019 the company acquired their business (then called PT Biogas Holdings Limited) from Pressure Technologies for £10.1million:

* £2.0 million in cash
* £2.0 million in Special Warrants at a deemed value of $0.20 per share. They were converted into 17,418,000 Common Shares and 8,709,000 Warrants on August 9, 2019
* £6.1 million in the form of a promissory note. It has a duration of 48 months and has an interest rate of 7%.
* The PT Intercompany Debt (debt contracted before the separation) was outstanding in the amount of $0.7 million and is being paid in 9 installments.

In 2019 company entered into Integrated Biogas Alliance (IBA) that promises to provide customers with fully integrated organic waste to renewable energy platform solutions. This may be advantageous since they do not make the anaerobic decomposition facilities as well as any other facility that creates biogas. Thus these kinds of partnerships are very important if they work as intended.

In 2020 company signed an agreement contract with SWEN Capital Partners to create JV Co. This is a project that will help reduce the upfront costs of RNG technology installation in Europe. In essence, the company will create Special Purpose Companies where SWEN is the majority owner. The equipment will be loaned to the client that will pay it off in a monthly installment. At the end of the payment, the client will be the owner of the equipment. This will reduce the need for the huge upfront cost (2+ million) and as a result, will increase the number of projects and clients (in theory).

# Management and Governance

https://preview.redd.it/c3hclthb2pc61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a76ed2f9b5fe9ab8e048abc3bf9a04872e7dc487

Recently they issued new stock in the amount of 10,600,000 common shares at $2,17. The purchaser can opt for an additional 15% (1,590,000 shares) after the deal. This gives them a lot of liquidity but at the same time dilutes the shares even more.

One of the most worrying things about this company is that its executives are being compensated with stock options. This deludes the stock and incentivizes them to grow the stock price and not the company itself.

https://preview.redd.it/8evvfpfm2pc61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f4b7248a4d7e438461c159509ed480a38eb9fd

https://preview.redd.it/3cdrmn9n2pc61.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=15f7513501ea90a29e97c58279cad0e8584c0f38

The management cut down on the stock options compensation but raised a lot of the salaries. Since the company did not hire new personnel the salary rase is way too extreme. Something to keep an eye on in the future.

Management does own many shares in the company. It seems that they are keeping them after they are granted the options.

# Risk Factors

* The company has a limited amount of clients and thus the revenues are at risk. The acquisition of new clients is also a difficult and irregular task creating more volatility.
* The company relies fully on the suppliers for the manufacturing and installation of the buildings. There is no list of the suppliers and the only information that we have is that some parts are produced exclusively by 1 supplier putting the company in a difficult position if that supplier can no longer serve them. Long-term contracts can mitigate that risk and yet the company does not disclose any information about that either.
* Due to a large number of Warrants, the delusion of stocks is a guaranty.
* The company is still unprofitable and has some obligations, making it more difficult to expand its core business.

# Competitive Positioning

https://preview.redd.it/hyizpsvw2pc61.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed8cedf084b046fc017b2af32cc38bf758e1fbe5

The only reference that can be found of the competition is done by the company so we need to take this information with a grain of salt. They do have all 3 main ways of making biomethane and so they offer a bigger range to their customers, however, they do not produce the equipment themselves and thus there is always a risk when it comes to their margins and their overall competitiveness.

# Financial Analyses

In 3Q of 2020 the results were:

### Balance Sheet

https://preview.redd.it/601ml7u43pc61.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5a835f38b4ab2126b716ae509bb9ca78ba02a94

It is notable that most of their assets are actually goodwill and intangible items. If we take the goodwill out of the equation we will have total assets of 21,292,000$.

They do have a working capital deficit of 0,3million. This is mostly due to the promissory note that became a current liability.

Their debt is 1/4 of their assets and their debt to sales is (accounting for the last 9 months) 0,4.

However, they do seem to finance their expenditures and everything else with stock issuance. This may be fine for now due to high-interest rates for credit and yet later on this will need to change.

### Income Statement:

https://preview.redd.it/ri0rw0973pc61.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=da2296d361713f75eede57482075f246cc4b3c4c

Their revenues have grown by almost 300% for the 9 months of 2020 compared to 2019.

Their gross margin did not change and remained at 30%. Their operating margins are still negative and decreasing. This is likely due to more projects and no revenues due to how long the projects actually take.

As of September 30, 2020, they had a backlog of $43.8 million and a pipeline of $690 Million

The top 5 customers accounted for 11%, 11%, 12%, 19% and 22% of total revenue (75% in total)

The net income of 743,000$ is due to the reduction in debt to be paid in the promissory note. If not for that the company has a loss of approximately 1,000,000$

Most of the revenues come from the sales of their upgrading kits and yet a large part of their aftercare service is still not caught up to the rest. This can be due to the majority of the projects still being in the works but it can also be due to weak customer retention. They do not provide the numbers for that so we can only guess.

https://preview.redd.it/e849itab3pc61.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa613322639bf9ad79d25c47389b7fddc4f06e8b

The fact that there are no new projects in Europe this year is also strange. Their partnership with SWEN can be in jeopardy if they are not able to get new contracts in Europe. Most of the aftercare revenue comes from Europe with nice growth in the US and Canada.

### Cash Flow Statement:

https://preview.redd.it/qzz5in2g3pc61.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=699a15ed2b51f7a1f1951e1174c2181dafd01040

For now, most of their cash flow is coming from financing activities such as the issuance of stocks and warrants as well as from stock options and warrants exercised. They are on the path to profitability and yet they are still running negative on operations. CEO said that at $30 Million they can start being profitable. There is still a long road to that but almost $50 Million in backlog can be a great start.

# Valuation

At 2,66$ per share and at a share count of around 140,000,000 (after recent share offering, warrants, and compensation) the total market cap is 372,000,000$ and the Price/Sales (considering the sales as their backlog) is around 8. With more realistic sales of $9-10 Million per year, the Price/Sales is around 40.

# Conclusion

There is a lot of growth potential and yet their competitive positioning is something to keep an eye on. Most of the risk comes from their asset-light model that has to prove that it can work. It already has a high valuation for an unprofitable small-cap operation. Honestly, I'm not sure what to make out of it. Seems like a great opportunity and yet not sure how likely they are to take advantage of the market potential that they have.","self","https://redd.it/l1zogp"

I am also not assuming but slightly preferential to the idea that as the rollout of the vaccination would allow for less restrictive lockdowns and retail traders will exit their positions to spend their money. If so from a value perspective (FYI I am not a value investor, although I believe in the ideals but my personal outlook on the economy doesn't follow value investing) most of them would say that equities are overvalued.

He chats in detail about the strategy in the podcast, but he looks at 40 of the top long/short hedge funds that he thinks are good candidates for replication, and he uses a model to reverse engineer what their aggregate asset allocation is. The model isn't able to figure out every single individual stock, but it can apparently get a pretty accurate sense of their long and short asset allocation which accounts for nearly all performance. The ETF rebalances monthly so it's a pretty up-to-date replication. The ETF has a 0.85% expense ratio, lower than hedge funds obviously but still high enough that it needs to work well to be worth it. [https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE04ODY0NDAzMjg4/episode/OWFmODFkZDItNWNlNy0xMWViLTk4OTctYjc2YWFhZTRjMzU5?sa=X&ved=0CAIQuIEEahcKEwiYrfnW07PuAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmJsb29tYmVyZy5mbS9CTE04ODY0NDAzMjg4/episode/OWFmODFkZDItNWNlNy0xMWViLTk4OTctYjc2YWFhZTRjMzU5?sa=X&ved=0CAIQuIEEahcKEwiYrfnW07PuAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAg)

Most hedge fund replication strategies just copy long holdings of hedge funds that are reported in 13F's 45 days after the end of the quarter, which I actually also think is an interesting approach, but those strategies tend to have more downside than the market since they're just copying long positions without any way of knowing about those hedge funds' short positions.

DBEH has been around for 1 year now, and so far it's checked 2 pretty key boxes for me. I've attached 2 graphs here for each.

In the first graph, you'll see that its short positions gave it more downside protection during March/April 2020 than the market (blue line is DBEH and red is SPY in the graph below). It also dipped less than dividend growth stocks (orange in the graph) which are often used for defense.

[In March\/April 2020, DBEH \(blue\) had quite a bit more downside protection than both the S&P \(red\) and dividend growth stocks \(orange\).](https://preview.redd.it/1uq99tda9dd61.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=14bd8722e87d500300f863a3024471668c00fcac)

In the second graph, you'll see that DBEH has participated in the value rotation that we've seen since September. Blue is DBEH, red is the S&P, and orange is the Vanguard Value ETF. In the podcast, Andrew says that hedge funds concentrated correctly towards tech during the early days of the Covid recession, but also moved towards value correctly by mid-summer.

[Since September, DBEH has participated in the outperformance of value stocks. Blue is DBEH, red is the S&P, and orange is VTV.](https://preview.redd.it/b2r31x7cadd61.png?width=1413&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2aee53e0add7fddc03d7301eed7a797f41b70ae)

As of mid September, DEBH was actually square in the middle of the Morningstar style box too, which makes the fact that it participated in value's resurgence especially impressive.

[As of 9\/16\/2020, DEBH was squarely in the large blend category, which makes the fact that it participated in value's resurgence especially impressive.](https://preview.redd.it/gylfadzwcdd61.png?width=555&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26b2f4e46bc75610ef06ef18698b735aef43c3)

Typically I'm pretty weary about newer strategies that haven't been tested for a few years and haven't been thoroughly analyzed by places like Morningstar. But in this case, I'm pretty sold on the approach - both for downside protection and as a good chance to participate in any trends we could see in the future, since hedge funds are free to alternate between value & growth and markets around the globe. Personally, I could see value or growth, US or overseas, outperforming in 2020, so I'm comfortable outsourcing these decisions to hedge funds for a portion of my portfolio. I plan to put about 5% of my portfolio into DBEH in a tax-protected account. There's a lot of turnover so I wouldn't suggest it in taxable accounts.","self","https://redd.it/l4ba77"

They are a *security company*. Revenue does not care about your AI driven autonomous machine learning EV car with DDs. People are using these terms loosely. A quick lookup for interviews with John Chen would prove that he explicitly avoids these terms as they do not define nor matter to the products/revenue of BlackBerry. QNX revenue does not depend on any of these terms, it's on installation on any device. This includes the space station, of which there is 1 of with obviously non-recurring revenue. Buying based on these basis would be gambling.

**Bull**:

* Business transformation: BlackBerry is now a software company, starting the transformation in 2015. The focus is security, the general term.
* 5 Products:  

   * QNX: Embedded system OS.  

      * Multi-OS housing: It has the capability to allow for multiple OSs on a single chip.
      * Real-time availability/software prioritization: Not all pieces of software operate on the same priority. Steering/braking would be higher priority than media, and QNX allows for that. Even if the thread/core is shared with other applications, when high priority software is requesting a resource it will be prioritized to ensure reliability.
      * Resource sharing: CPU, RAM, and GPU resource sharing between different applications capability. Two applications can share the same CPU core and bump each other based on prioritization.
      * Why not Linux? QNX has the highest certification for security available. Linux does not. CEOs would want to avoid liability and this certification allows for that.
      * Device agnostic: It can be installed on any device, not just cars. Any IoT and offline device can use QNX.
   * QNX Hypervisor: Consolidate multiple OSs on a single SoC using virtualization  

      * SoC: System on a chip. Instead of using multiple ECUs, which is what car manufacturers currently do, they can use one single chip to run multiple high priority applications and multiple OSs. This is what Tesla does now.
      * Virtualization: Running an OS in a virtual environment. Think Linux environment inside of Windows. This helps with debugging for developers without having to have the actual hardware.
   * IVY: Scalable cloud-connected software platform for vehicles.  

      * What is it a solution for? When a vehicle manufacturer wants a way to transmit the QNX/OS data safely, normalize it, and visualize it/interact with it. It also allows car manufacturers to own the data, unlike other OSs.
      * Scalable: AWS servers are capable of handling the load from many endpoints.
      * Software platform: There is currently no centralized software ecosystem for vehicles. IVY is providing that.
      * Non-BB developers would be able to use an SDK to develop applications on IVY for infotainment/general apps/others. IVY will also use ML to gain insight on unrecognized patterns by developers. An example of this is detecting if a car slipped, without having the developer connect multiple sensors to figure out if that event happened.
      * 50/50 joint effort on revenue and effort to develop the ecosystem. Using AWS's knowledge in AI/ML for calculated sensors (slip, driver on seat, etc)
      * Usage by other vendors: A city can connect to the data from vehicles and detect when ice/slipping is happening. If brakes are getting overheated coming from a high elevation area. If a car had an accident, etc. An insurance company can provide an app to give discounts similar to the currently implemented OBD-2 readers. A maintenance provider can also connect to this data and check if an error is specific to maintenance, malpractice, or general misuse.
   * Spark: Endpoint management. Basically API security. Did not delve far into this, basic info.  

      * Unified Endpoint Security: This is the endpoint where a laptop/phone/IoT device hits. It provides encryption and security around that. Continuous authentication is a part of it, where a device is learning the user behavior using ML and continuously checking if the behavior matches the original owner; if not, lock the device.
      * Unified Endpoint Management: Basically managing your API for devices.
      * Zero trust: I think this is specifically talking about continuous authentication. Basically, it's not an authenticate once and forget it. It's constantly tracking behavior to verify the user is the authenticated user.
   * AtHoc: Non-enterprise communication system.  

      * Target customers: Government, healthcare, education, etc.
      * Solution: A communication system targeting non-enterprise businesses; specifically for Event management, cross organizational communication/collaboration, mass notifications.
      * Who does this benefit? You've seen the hacks in healthcare/educational/governmental sector. This is specifically for them.
   * SecuSUITE: Phone application to allow employees to use work related data in personal devices without cross communication (between personal and work data).  

      * End to end encryption.
      * Separation of concerns between personal and work data. Employers CANNOT access your personal data.
      * Used by NATO; doesn't carry much value in my book but maybe in yours.
* Customer oriented solutions: As you've seen in the products above, some products overlap and are just names to target specific customers. It allows customers to easily understand what product could solve their issue. Continuous authentication is a great example of this: Their customer complained that they kept re-authenticating, so they designed a solution allowing them to authenticate once and using ML they learned their behavior and can continuously check if the user is the owner/authenticated user. This kind of passion in leadership is good for business.
* Liability: QNX has the highest security rating available. Most CEOs want to avoid liability when it comes to security, using QNX would help them avoid that in a similar way cloud services help them avoid being blamed for hacking.
* Leadership: BBs leadership isn't one to play on famous words to drive the stock up. John Chen explicitly states this in his interviews and says they are a security company. Not cyber, doesn't mention AI or whatever. He explicitly avoids meme words and understands what the point of BBs business is.

Where I think growth can be made:

1. QNX in more cars. They can capitalize on the idea of less ECUs = less cost for OEMs + security.
2. IVY usage by OEMs along with QNX.
3. IVY ecosystem. Maybe application billing?
4. Professional services (support) for the products listed.
5. AtHoc increased market share in more governmental/healthcare/educational entities.
6. SecuSUITE for more enterprise customers with the idea being saving employers money from purchasing work phones for employees, and worrying about securing them.

**Bear**:

* Revenue: It is not yet based on a subscription/usage basis. You can only produce so many cars, and they don't give an insight on how much do they charge per car for QNX. Anywhere from $2 - $20 is what was mentioned in transcripts. This is a growth area, but not at a trajectory that's excellent. IVY does work on a subscription/usage basis, but IVY can be used WITHOUT QNX. I'm worried about this, but still see it as an area that will generate revenue in the range of $400 MM - $600 MM at the price of $20 per 30M cars. The 30M per year is based on the listing of their customers and their yearly production rates. Keep in mind I stated any device, this does not include trucks or other IoT devices.
* Market share: These are relatively new products. J.P. Morgan pointed this out as a priority for growth. This could end up not working out and growth never happens. This is a relatively low risk due to QNX and IVY providing SO MUCH value for car manufacturers Vs. other products in the market.
* Patent revenue: They sold a chunk of their no longer relevant patents to Huawei. This makes up a small (<= 32%) of their revenue and is a one time sale. The coming quarter could be equal or less to the last quarter revenue due to either other sales making up the lost revenue from patents, or coming up short. It could come higher if they sold more services, but due to COVID and knowing that many car manufacturers have lowered their production due to chip shortage, the next quarter will most likely be lower.
* VW.os: VW is making their own OS. VW.os is what they're calling it. They're currently using QNX, but that revenue could potentially stop. Personally I don't believe VW is capable of doing that. It's a marketing hype. Their companies are not capable of good collaboration or good implementation based on what I've read and researched (can't find article right now), but it's something to be concerned about.
* QNX success: While IVY could be using QNX, it does NOT depend on it. There is potential for OEMs to use IVY without QNX. I think this is a low risk, but still risk. 19 OEMs are already using QNX.
* Lack of Answers: I can't get much out of their earnings call. They don't delve into pricing for QNX, how they plan to grow it besides getting more car manufacturers and more cars post Corona. How they plan to do recurring revenue. A breakdown of each revenue segment would be helpful, but I don't see that either and there is hesitancy to delve into it.

**Prediction**: I think QNX can become a $1B revenue per year alone. $2B revenue per year as a company is not far fetched. Without a subscription/usage based model, it is difficult to see how growth can go beyond that. BB is good in 2-5 years, not this year. I can see their revenue growing to potentially $2B - $4B revenue per year. They did mention trying to figure out a subscription/usage based billing, if done then the revenue would be much higher. I think $18 is a fair price on the high end. It could grow further than that, but expectations would be HIGH.

As of writing this, HUYA is currently trading at $25. I think it's cyclicality can see it descend to $20, and I will enter a position once it is in that ballpark. This is a long term hold as the merger will take several months to complete and for the market to adjust accordingly. The potential short squeeze is just an added bonus. I will be working on a DCF valuation for the company in the coming weeks and will post that here as well.

HUYA Inc., ticker HUYA, is a Chinese live streaming platform. It is the APAC equivalent to
Twitch.tv and has a stranglehold on the industry there. HUYA is a subsidiary of Tencent,
one of the biggest and most prominent names in China’s economy and in global
entertainment, infamous for aggressively buying activist positions on Western media
companies and owning a significant portion of the world entertainment market share
through the subsidiaries it has purchased. Tencent’s majority in HUYA is controlled via
proxy with YY inc, ($YY). While directly being financed by Tencent, Tencent fronts HUYA
through YY Inc., which in of itself is the biggest streaming platform in the APAC region and
is a key player on the Nasdaq. With HUYA now merging with the only competitor in the
market, Tencent officially dominates and controls the live streaming industry of its mother
country, which will be maintainable through its deep-rooted relations with the Chinese
legislators and through the puppet war it poses, with HUYA and YY both being publicly
listed on the North American exchanges play-fighting as competitors, while in reality being
two of the same kin.

HUYA is the only member of its sector to be cash flow positive, while essentially being the
only peer at all. There are only two other competitors in the live streaming sector of China
and HUYA is in talks to buy out its second-most rival, DouYu International. The other
competitor, Tian Ge Interactive, is of no significance due it’s microscopic market cap and
consistent failure to generate cash flows. The merger is set to complete within the first half
of 2021, with DouYu integrating itself into HUYA’s capital structure and delisting itself from
the markets. This merger will bring HUYA to a monopoly sized level of market share, going
from 125 million active users to over 300 million when combined with DouYu’s streaming
platform. With its mother company YY actively participating in the market with a supporting
role, this now leads Tencent to having 600 Million users of the Total Addressable Market of
China. Assuming this platform will derive its users mainly from major cities and urban
environments, the total addressable market equates to the total number of Chinese citizens
living in densely populated urban area - which is 57% of the Chinese population. As it
stands, that is 798 million people. In short, Tencent will now own 75% of the Total
Addressable Market once this merger goes through.

HUYA shows income statement numbers on par with your typical growth phase company.
they are keeping a steady COGS, while aggressively growing net income, sales, and EBIT.
Currently COGS is 51% of revenue, but is down nearly 25% year-over year. Revenue has gone from $114 Million in 2016 to $1.2 Billion in 2019. Gross profit has grown from -42 Million to 318 Million in the same time frame. This gives HUYA a 3-year sales CAGR of 119%. There seems to be a steady trail of share dilution quarter over quarter, despite EPS showing no growth in the same time period. share dilution can impact future equity fundraising should it be overdone. sourcing supplies comes at an incredibly cheap price for the
company due to the intense monopoly of its parent company. It derives over 90% of its
COGS from JOYY and Tencent. knowing that it is in the best interest of one of the biggest
companies in China that HUYA sustains low COGS, high margins, and cheap equity
financing, this shows us the golden cog of this ever-growing machine. HUYA has direct 
access to whatever funds Tencent puts towards live streaming for the foreseeable future.
This reassurance has been guaranteed through the balance sheet so far, as the company
has taken a little to no debt since its inception and has in fact seen declining long-term
debt, going from $12 Million in June of 2019 to $9 Million as of June 2020. For a company
valued at $6 billion, this is chump change. 

In spite of this, HUYA is in the midst of an incredible short float, with 37% of the shares
outstanding being shorted. The source of this bearish activity comes almost entirely from
hedge funds and short-term traders on the North American markets. This is
understandable, as Chinese companies are incredibly shady and require much more due
diligence than any company in the West. However, this fear can be dissolved with help from
the Benford test. Benford’s Law is used to identify numerical irregularities in large data sets.
In 2014 researchers at Harvard and Columbia university aggregated all financial
statements by industry from the years 2000 to 2011 and found that approximately 83% of
firm’s financial statements were legitimate. Very few Chinese companies have successfully
passed the Benford test. Notable companies who have passed however include the likes of
Alibaba and JD, two retail titans. The test assesses suspicious fundraising, high gross
margins with the low operating expenditures, the liquidity ratios of the company, noticeably
low or decline in revenue, if the IPO was a reverse merger and if there is a considerable
lack of insider ownership (<5%). HUYA passed the test with the same exact marks as
Alibaba. 

Whether or not this short squeeze will come to life depends on the growth of the share
price. However, the company has been somewhat cyclical since it went public three years
ago. A major antithesis to the short sellers is the presence of Cathy Wood, the manager of
the famous ARK Invest, who purchased a significant portion of HUYA shares to add to the
fund’s product – ARKW. Cathy Wood believes HUYA will be an industry leader in the tech
and entertainment sector of the emerging APAC markets. 

Overall the aggressive profitability, industrial monopoly, upcoming merger, and nearguarantee of cheap debt and equity financing from one of the biggest companies in the
country, HUYA may be set to see incredible bouts of growth in the upcoming quarters. The
irrational fear of those short selling the company will be utilized by the market to drive the
price up to levels never before seen.

For that matter if you are a mega short seller of the above or anything else that is going stratospheric why not just offer the company new money and get the shares you need through new issue at a discount?

I think the smartest defensive move Facebook can make at this stage is doing whatever it takes to become a major player in consumer hardware. Even if they breakeven, or lose money on this endeavor it can be treated as user acquisition costs for the people who wouldn't make a Facebook account otherwise, or as a way to make Facebook accounts as sticky as possible to protect against people leaving the platform. Anecdotally, I've seen **people that have preached ""Facebook is evil"" for years, say that not they will not ever delete their newly open accounts** because if they did their Oculus hardware wouldn't work, and they'd lose all of their purchases.

Facebook is dominating the growing VR market with an iron fist. **Non-advertising revenue grew 156%** in Q4, and IDC estimates 3 million [Quest 2's were sold in Q4](https://twitter.com/somospostpc/status/1354879840097337349). Oculus Quest 2 has stellar reviews, despite the mandatory Facebook account for use. Facebook's VR devices also use Messenger for messages, Workplace for enterprise, and I believe [Facebook Horizon](https://www.oculus.com/facebook-horizon/) (which is integrated with the FB app) will eventually be the place users load into initially, and launch third party apps from.

High investment cost makes it unlikely that other social media company can compete with Facebook in hardware (especially AR/VR), and this should give Facebook a permanent utility advantage against its peers. The companies that could compete, big tech, and gaming giants seem unwilling to make the investment to compete. I think they're aware that Facebook is completely fine making $0 to be dominant in the VR space, and that's scared them away in addition to facts like VR being a relatively small market for them.[Apple is rumored to be considering a release of a Quest-like headset in later 2022, but the device will be priced far above $1000 according to Mark Gurman.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses)

VR is where I'm most confident in Facebook's ability to achieve its hardware dreams, but consumer AR is also an area where its only competition in terms of investments made is Apple. So I think their chances there are decent too. Facebook is working on long term AR glasses, but is also releasing Smartglasses in collaboration with Luxottica (Ray-Ban and Oakley) this year. There's also Facebook's line of smart video chatting devices, Portal.

**Traditionally Listed Moats**

Intangible assets consisting of the vast amount of data users have shared: **sustained and growing**, but people are also sharing things about themselves on other apps increasingly.

Growth of users means **network effects still growing**

Number and diversity of advertisers, and advertiser verticals **still growing**

**Competition?**

There is rising social media competition, and always the threat of new entrants. That being said, competition seems to carve out niches, so they aren't competing as directly as we'd think. The closest thing to Facebook the Blue app, for connecting with family and friends is Instagram. Competing apps can have similar features, but the main utilities are different. Tik Tok is mostly a short video app, Youtube is a long video app, Twitter is a breaking news app, Reddit is a communities app, etc. **Facebook's utility first and foremost is connecting with REAL people who's identity you can verify, like friends and family. Like previously mentioned, the closest competitor is Instagram.**

**Messaging**

There can be lack of differentiation here, but **Messenger tied to Facebook, Instagram, Portal and Oculus.** I suspect it'll be tied to future hardware as well. Whatsapp has network effects, and may one day have lock-in comparable to Chinese super apps (at least that's what's being worked towards). iMessage is the the main competitor here, because they are automatically installed on every iPhone

**Misc**

I think Facebook Marketplace, the Craigslist alternative **benefits greatly from Facebook using real identities**, and is an overall better product. If you want to sell something locally FB Marketplace is the best option, and I think it's a strong reason to have an account. Usage of Marketplace is growing.

The integration with Jio in India, and importance in Indian society is worth mentioning for Whatsapp.

Facebook Groups, have competition in the form of Reddit, and Discord. The edge here will be real identities, and the tools they are building to make moderating a Facebook group profitable (subscriptions, etc)

The only other pure ""Real Identity social network"" is Linkedin is a professional network.

**Problems**

**No young people use Facebook?** This seems to be a US centric cliche, as Facebook is popular among all age demographics around the world. [According to Pew Research 76% of people 18-24 use Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/), only superseded by Youtube. For teens in 2018, [51% of teens used Facebook](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/) which is good in my opinion for a social network not targeted to teens like Tik Tok. I personally think the utility of Facebook kicks in after college age, **but regardless if there is a problem, I think the cure can be User Acquisition through hardware.**

**Chance of mass exodus?** again, **mitigated by the lock-in of hardware**, but this is a concern of mine based on Facebook's reputation. **1. Privacy**, there is truth to some criticism here, because Facebook's business model does depend on data collection, and in many ways is opposed to strict definitions of privacy, but much of it is also pushed by myth like ""Facebook sells data"". **Facebook has the same business model as its advertising funded peers, but perception is what matters,** and Facebook is losing the perception battle. **2. Politics,** In my opinion has been half of Facebook's reputation problem. Recently Zuck said that **they are trying to make Facebook less political by not recommending political groups, and lowering reach on political posts**. Also, Donald Trump being gone should make the next 4 years less politically controversial. Since Facebook is in the business of advertising, and people can mostly say what they want, **there's always the small chance of a #DeleteFacebook movement reaching critical mass based on these themes.**

**Being banned in countries?** Mitigated **by becoming a hardware player,** but this is an unlikely outcome for many reasons that my hands are too tired to elaborate on.

**Apple's privacy stance and iOS 14:** The hit to revenue estimates I've seen are between 1%-7%, but it could also be a boost to revenue **since third party signals being reduced will give the edge to whoever has the best first party signals**, we'll have wait to see. This is something to watch closely, but transferring third party data into first party data by having ecommerce on the platform through initiatives like **Facebooks shops, and Instagram shopping can be the cure**. Also, **being in control of hardware mitigates this risk**

**Antitrust-** generally **not concerned**

**Privacy as a theme that is adversarial to advertising -** slightly concerned but **I don't think ad funded business models are going anywhere**, many people like not paying for things

**Might add more to this later...**","self","https://redd.it/l9hhf6"

One of the biggest joys of security analysis is developing research that anticipates accurately what will happen, or when wrong let’s one learn what you did wrong and how you can change your research. 

but I rarely get that here. 

We never see the outcome is of the research presented here and whether OP ever made an investment or opened a position based on their research. Perhaps some of these are school projects, or just random medium posts to send traffic to investment blogs, which is why a conclusion/update rarely gets reached on the DD.

Here are my thoughts","Discussion",0.9,113,0,0,91,0,"I have followed the tobacco industry for years, but never invested. At a minimum, it's a great history lesson (there's a good reason the [US capitol building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_of_Columns) is adorned with tobacco leaves). The industry is the classic definition of simple, but not easy.

Clearly the industry has headwinds. It always has. Right now, they feel particularly existential in the form of competition from legal marijuana and e-vapor.

But COVID has changed the landscape. Volume leveled off for the first time in five years! As for e-vapor, it looks like more like the ability to navigate the regulatory issues will be the single most important factor for success. Clearly, Big Tobacco is in the best position to do this thanks to their seasoned legal teams and lobbyists. One thing is for sure, in the long-term, people will get their nicotine, it's just a matter of the form it will take.

The big three companies - Altria, Philip Morris and BAT are cheap. They trade at 10% cash flow yields with 80% payouts (which in this industry is arguably fine). They have plenty of cash to fund growth opportunities, which are going well, all things considered. While COVID has been a setback for Altria's heat-not-burn roll-out, it has been a boon for its combustible business. Meanwhile heat-not-burn is [20% of Philip Morris's volume](https://philipmorrisinternational.gcs-web.com/static-files/5c5df2d7-ebff-45bb-97d8-cfde31b5d206) already!

Therefore, it's hard to tell how much of the current price is a result of a) legitimate threats to the business or b) the rise of ESG, the ethics of the industry, and fund managers' unwillingness to invest in the ""death merchants"".

In my opinion, all of this reiterates the immutable fact of the tobacco industry - The oligopoly will persist, if not forever, for a very, very long time to come (long enough to return a lot of cash in the form of both dividends and [buybacks](https://investor.altria.com/press-releases/news-details/2021/Altria-Reports-2020-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Results-Provides-2021-Full-Year-Earnings-Guidance-Announces-New-2-Billion-Share-Repurchase-Program/default.aspx)).

Had this question on my mind for a bit. One of my first trading mistakes was holding a leveraged bear etf overnight. It was SPXU , despite guessing the direction of the SP500 that day, I forgot to sell before end of day and watched all my earnings get wiped out. 
On the day that oil was worth negative monies last year. I watched DWT (now extinct 3x bear leverage etf on oil ) skyrocket from 11 to 40 a share practically in an hour. 


I’m still learning but was wondering , how does one tame these leveraged etfs ? What kind of use do they have for the average investor ? 

Thank you for your replies in advance.

The US/EU/JAP will be forced to artificially manufacture inflation to move clear of the Zero Lower Bound, they can't go negative otherwise people will just run to ATMs and hoard cash [bonus counterexample]","Short Thesis",0.73,16,0,0,49,0,"The Zero Lower Bound is also known as the moment when the rubber meets the road. Nominal Interest Rate on overnight deposits at the Central Bank and the equivalent short term government bonds  pay out zero, zip, nada, nulla...percentage wise.

Many people attribute the fact that we are at the Zero Lower Bound to the top down decisions of Central Banks. It is them, in fact which decide the Nominal Rate on overnight loans between banks to meet the cash requirements to be held at the Central Bank per the regulations specifically put in place by the Central Bank itself.

Reality is that the Central Bank is not God. It has very little room for manouver and generally +/- 500bps the rate of interest on short term overnight loans is approximately the same as it would be without its intervention.

So if it's not the Central Bank driving the charge and being God establishing the rate, then who is it? Well It's us! It's us with our behavior and how we behave with our finances, most importantly how much do we spend and how our expenditure creates inflation.

Inflation is the rise of prices as measured in the unitary currency of controlled by the Central Bank of the country being examined.
In the US the 2 indicators used by the Fed are the CPI and the PCE, those measure year over year, so when they are positive it means that there is, in fact inflation. When they are negative it means the phenomenon at play is deflation.

Inflationary and deflationary forces square off every day in the global and domestic economy to produce the result which is measured monthly by the aforementioned (CPI, PCE) indicators .

Now for inflation to happen there has to be a level of impulsivity which compels people to act on it and create a scenario in which money chases goods thus enabling vendors and retailers to rise the price. Matter of fact this is happening less and less and there are are some secular trends which favor deflation over inflation, they are just beginning to produce their effect upon the global economy :

1) Aging demographic, people become less impulsive as they age

2) Population (even young people) are increasingly risk averse compared to the past and you can see this everywhere, not only in finance, people live in the NOW less and less and thus are less impulsive, below some non financial trends

* a) Cigarette consumption is down

* b) Drugs consumption is down, especially stimulants

* c) Alcohol consumption is down

* d) ER visits due to bar brawls and domestic injuries are down

* e) Violence all around is down

* f) Sexual intercourses per year is down

* g) Number of female sex partners per male is down

* h) Age of first sexual intercourse is pushed in the 20s, whereas people would already fathered 100s of kids back in the Middle Ages

* i) You have 80 yr old people still buying 30 year govt. bonds investing ""for the future"" whlist they are literally about to die and become nothing for the rest of time

* l) Space is our frontier very much like the Ocean was for the people in the Bronze age....we have lost zero people in space, ZERO! And zero ships, that alone means we are playing it too conservative out of fear

* m) Finally I know i'll get a lot of flak for this but the lockdowns, honestly we would have never locked down in the 80s 90s 00s... for a disease which statistically trims a few months off people lives

3) The rise of platforms such as Amazon, Ebay, Trivago which eliminate price slippage and enable vendors to front run their competitors by lowering the price by a fraction of a penny. This eliminates holes in the price making, and enables the consumer to sort by price. Eliminating slippage and  price holes is a huge blow to inflation. We've seen nothing yet, e-commerce is just a few percentage of the total purchases in the US and it will reach 100% in the coming decades, plus **if you exclude platforms like trivago and fiverr we still don't have an Amazon for services, that would completely eviscerate inflation**.

Given that the rate of interest follows inflation/deflation this means that if left alone the interest rate will follow suit and head into the negative. 

**And here lies the problem, interest rate cannot go into the negative because people and companies would rather withdraw money from the bank and hold them in the form of banknotes which would NOT carry the negative component. That could potentially signify the return to the stoneage of Banking, the end of fractional reserve and the collapse of the financial system. Suffices to say that government will not allow this to happen.**

The big question which is also the base of the investment thesis being presented here is : 

**How will they avoid financial armageddon?**

**The answer is by artificially manufacturing enough inflation to move away from the Zero area and thus have the Interest rate follow suit and move away from the Zero Lower Bound.**

Note that this move is disconnected by monetary policy consideration and solely done to propel the financial system away from the Zero bound and contrast deflationary pressures which are still in the very beginning and have a lot of energy yet to unleash (think of deflationary pressures as an Cat-5 Hurricane which is only now forming offshore Cabo Verde and will hit Florida in 3 weeks time).

Also note that how is inflation artificially manufactured is not important , there are in fact various way of doing this, namely: helicopter money, QE for the people, stimulous checks, central banks monetizing government deficits and so forth.

**It's not important because the goal is always the same: inundating consumers with cash in the hope that they feel rich enough to start consuming again (acting on the impulse of purchasing again) and stop saving/investing (being fearful of the future and behaving in a risk averse manner)** 

So what's the play in the markets for the aforementioned scenario?

Government bonds carry a so called coupon, which is the rate of interest those bonds pay semi-annually to the holder. In almost all bonds (exception being the Inflation Protected Bonds) the coupon represents the nominal rate (not to be confused from the real rate which is nominal rate-inflation rate) . The coupon is dependant upon the prevailing rates which was in place when the bond was issued by the Treasury.

We've been in the proximity of the Zero Lower Bound for a whole lot of time after 2008, after a short rise during the Trump presidency COVID happened and we're back again at Zero.

This is a huge opportunity because all the bonds being issued by the G-20 Government since 2008 basically all have a coupon which is proximous to Zero.

As said earlier G-20 governments/Central Banks will be forced to manufacture some inflation and that would carry the Treasury bonds rate upwards as well (because savers would not bid over each other anymore for the privilege of lending to the Government at 0.25% because that would not protect them against inflation anymore)

What happens when inflation is manufactured and Treasury begins to issue bonds with a coupon which is more in line with an inflation which is rising (opposed to the strongest deflationary forces mentioned above)?

It means that the bonds issued 2008-present begin to look less attractive because they carry a coupon much smaller compared to the one of the newly issued bonds. When a bond become inconvenient to hold, people start looking for exits and buyers are hard to come by, in other words the price of the bond collapses 
(when the price of a bond collapses its yield rises).

As per the title says this thesis implies shorting bonds which were issued 2008-present because if the scenario outlined in the thesis is compelling, then investors who hold those bonds will head towards the exits and at the same time they won't find many buyers given that newly issued one will incrementally have a higher coupon to match the raising inflation manufactured by G-20 Governments and Central Banks 


.

Potential risks in the thesis: 

1) Central Banks actually go negative and banks manage to avoid passing the negative component to their customers. They get squeezed and on the brink of failure, but G20 governments keep bailing them out . The banking sector would become de-facto nationalized 

**Counter Example:**

1) Central Banks go negative and banks pass the negative component to their customers. But banking being so important for the global economy and having globalization completely taken over the economy, then people will swallow the pill of negative rates on their deposits . After all when you withdraw money and store it in the form of cash you can do nothing but a fraction of what you are able to do if you have money in the bank (even if you collect a negative rate) . You can't move money anywhere if not in the very close physical proximity, thus if you are an individual or a company your purchasing options would be limited at the physical proximity vendors where you can physically bring cash (in the form of banknotes) to and pay them with banknotes. Also you'd have to protect the loot as it's an open invitation for brulgaries .

So what's the trade for this counterexample?

It's the opposite, understanding that the Central Banks don't have to manufacture inflation to go negative, hence they will go negative by following the deflationary pressures mentioned above . So today's bonds paying 0,458% are a bargain compared to what's about to come, hence migth as well go long on them","self","https://redd.it/lblbvd"

I need opinions from people smarter than me.

NACCO Industries ($NC) is a coal miner that is pivoting their business away from coal mining and to a miner-for-hire fee-based management structure. Basically they let someone else own the land and take a fee based on the tonnage of material extracted and delivered to the land owner. This is a small but growing segment of their business making up a negligible amount of their revenue in 2018, 30% in 2019, and 31% through Q3 in 2020. This is a very small company with total revenues across all segments being $135m in 2018, $140m in 2019, and $105m for 9 months ending in Sept 2020. 

Currently, their main material is limestone which they extract from 20 quarries owned by 10 different customers. 

However, in 2019, they signed an exclusive contract with Lithium Americas ($LAC) to be the exclusive miner of the Thacker Pass lithium development in Northern Nevada. $LAC has been in the news a lot for the Thacker Pass project and it's stock is up over 300% in the last 12 months. The development is believed to be the largest lithium deposit in the United States and is estimated to have a little over 3 million tonnes of lithium. Last month, LAC and NC received approval from the Bureau of Land Management to begin construction of the mine. $NC is fronting $50m to build the mine which should be ready to begin production in 2023. 

In the technical report made to the BLM, LAC/NC estimated 300% growth in the demand for Lithium from 2017 to 2025 with an estimated price of $12,000 per tonne (prices now are between $9,000 and $10,000). The report also says they expect to extract 30,000 tonnes in the first 3.5 years and then 60,000 tonnes for the next 42 years (If we're doing the math, that's $360m of lithium per year for the first 3.5 years and $720m per year thereafter). 

Let's remember that they are only being paid a fee per tonne of ore extracted and those are numbers for the refined lithium. The lithium is estimated to have a concentration of .33% meaning to pull 60,000 tonnes of lithium, you would need to mine 18 million tonnes of ore. The details of the contract signed with LAC have not been disclosed so we don't know how much revenue to expect from this operation. This is where the opportunity lies, in my opinion. 

If we look at their existing limestone operation as a guide (those contracts are also not public that I could find), they extracted 10.2 million tonnes in 2019 and 11.6 million tonnes in 2020 creating $8.9m and $9.4m in revenue respectively. From what I can find, limestone is currently valued around $30 per ton meaning they received about 25% of the value as their fee. I don't think we can expect 25% but hell, even 5% of the value of this lithium would double the contract mining segment's revenue and increase the total company revenue by 10-20%. 

The big takeaway here is that we have A LOT of uncertainty. We don't know what lithium prices will look like, we don't know what the fee structure of the contract with LAC is, and we don't know what the costs of this revenue will be. 

HOWEVER. This stock is currently trading under 60% of book value. It's at a P/E under 7. They have nearly no debt and over $100m in cash (some of which is earmarked for the mine construction undoubtedly). The downside on this seems very small with an upside that looks very, very promising. The risks associated with the future uncertainty seems more than offset by the valuation. They've got cash, cash flow, and a growth story in front of them as they change the trajectory of their business away from coal mining and hopefully use Thacker Pass as a springboard to other major projects.  

Admittedly, I know nothing about miners or the materials industry. Am I completely off base here or is this a diamond in the rough?

edit disclaimer: I opened a small position in $NC earlier this week when I found it. I plan on increasing that position if it withstands further scrutiny so please poke holes in my thesis.","self","https://redd.it/ld7fuv"

&#x200B;

On SPACs:

&#x200B;

>See, how can I put this kindly? I can't, so I'll say it. The narrative, the story that we see around WallStreetBets, that we see around SPACs, the story is that this is democratization of markets, it's bullshit and the the people who are presenting that as their message are bullshitters. I can't say it nicely so I just had to say it that way. It is just, its another story, that's what Wall Street has always been and frankly it's what I think it will always be. \[...\] Do I like what Wall Street did in reaction to Reddit? To change the capital posting rules at the clearing house overnight, to give Stevie and Gabe and other guys a day to throw the ballast and trim their sails so they could survive? No, that's bullshit too. There's a lot of it to go around but what really eats at me \[...\] it's the mendacity of the people who say either ""Oh, no, its our liberty, this is the best of all possible worlds that we give all of our money to Ken Griffin"", or similarly its the people who say ""Oh, no, we need a transaction tax now, that's clearly what we need to do here"" or ""Oh, no, this is democratization of markets. And by the way come put your money into my SPAC or into my ETF of SPACs"". I call them raccoons. I mean they are huckster animals that financial services are frankly infested with. Always has been, always will be but by golly if you see it you got to call it out.

&#x200B;

In answering comment about people getting hurt investing in volatile equities;

&#x200B;

>A lot of people have been hurt but welcome to the world man and these people are not your friends. Right, these people are not your friends. You are being used, you are not being treated as autonomous human being. You are being used as fodder and that was clearly true in the GameStop. And look, we went back, we've been analyzing the language, the linguistics of what you saw on WallStreetBets and what you see is that about a couple of months ago the language changed, the linguistics changed. There was absolutely, absolutely, a planned effort, I liken it to the, I call it the snowball theory of markets, to start a snowball at the top of the hill and to be positioned for where that snowball could end up, before the avalanche could end up and trying to roll some snowballs down the hill. You don't know which of these snowballs is going to take off or which is going to click as a meme but you do it enough and one of them is going to click and this democratization, you know, to the moon, diamond hands, stick it to the man by buying GameStop calls. This was absolutely a plan, it didn't happen organically and it sure ain't part of some democratic uprising. 

&#x200B;

Finally, answer to the question what is the meta narrative that country most needs to grapple with, most needs to understand and most needs to digest in order to get to a view of reality that corresponds to their model;

&#x200B;

>I think the most important thing, and I'll use a poker analogy here, you know the old line that if you don't know who the sucker is at the table after 30 minutes, it's you. The important thing here is not to stop plying poker, not to say ""Oh my god, the game is rigged and I'm out of here"", it's not to get off the grid and, you know, live out in the wilds of Alaska. The important thing here is to preserve some distance in your mind and in your heart between yourself and what you are told. To recognize that everything in markets and everything in politics is somebody shaking their finger at you and trying to tell you how to think about the world, what multiple should you put on this, what is the story we are going to put around the markets or this election or what have you. And its not to say you don't act in markets and elections. You vote, you invest, you do all that but you don't take these stories into your heart. You maintain a critical distance so that you maintain your autonomy of mind. If there's one message out here, its to do that. To think critically about everything you are reading here.

Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering the largest defense contractor in the United States; Lockheed Martin (LMT). This is my first attempt at writing a DD, so sorry in advance if it's dense.

**Business**

Lockheed Martin is a well-known federal defense contractor. Lockheed is responsible for some of the most storied and powerful fighter jets in the world such as the F-16, the C-130J Hercules, the F-35, and many more. They're also a very influential missile producer with offerings including the PAC-3 system, the THAAD System, the Javelin Missile, and the Hellfire Missile.

Lockheed gets 74% of its revenue comes from the US government, 25% of its revenue from international governments and 1% was from commercial and other customers.

Their operations can be broken up into 4 distinct segments: Aeronautics (40% of revenue), Rotary and Mission Systems (25% of revenue), Missiles & Fire Control (17% of revenue), and Space (18% of revenue). Let's take a closer look at these segments.

**Aeronautics**

This segment includes advanced military aircraft and unmanned drone production. This is probably Lockheed's most storied segment and is where a majority of people know them from. The F-35 program made up over 69% of the aeronautics segment's net sales in 2020 and is the crown jewel of Lockheed Martin's aerospace offerings. Production of the F-35 is expected to continue for a long time given the US government's inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft, commitments from 6 other international governments, and interest from other countries.

The drone part of this segment is very promising. Drone spending is expected to have a CAGR of 19.8% through 2023, and seeing as Lockheed is the largest drone producer in the US, they stand to benefit significantly.

In 2020, Lockheed Martin delivered 120 aircraft including 46 to international governments. This segment got 69% of its revenue from US government customers and 31% of its revenue from international governments.

**Missiles and Fire Control**

This segment provides air and missile defense systems, tactical missiles, and ground precision strike weapons. Some of their famous offerings include the Patriot Advanced Capability system and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system. They also have some more cutting-edge (and expensive) offerings such as the Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod and the Infrared Search and Track fire control system.

**Rotary and Mission Systems**

This segment provides commercial helicopters, surface ships, radar systems, cyber solutions, and simulation systems. This segment got 72% of its revenue from the US government, 25% came from international governments, and 3% came from commercial customers.

**Space**

This is the segment we know the least about as a lot of its operations are classified. The main customers of this segment are the US Air Force, the US Navy, and the National Guard. The US government accounted for 87% of revenues and the rest came from international customers.

This segment produces satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. One of the largest programs in this segment is the Trident II D5 Flett Ballistic Missle, the Space-Based Infrared System, and the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. I can see massive tailwinds making this a very profitable segment.

**Revenues**

Lockheed brought in revenue of $65.398 Billion in 2020, a 9.34% gain YoY, a 30.88% gain from 3 years ago, and a 61.33% gain from 5 years. I think these numbers are absolutely staggering considering the performance of other Aerospace companies this year (Raytheon's revenue contracted 26.55% YoY and General Dynamic's revenue declined  3.62% YoY).

Switching over to COGS, we have COGS of $56.744 Billion in 2020, an 8.82% gain YoY, a 30.90% growth from 3 years ago, and a 57.49% growth from 5 years ago. While these increases may seem large, I'd argue that in the Aerospace industry, it's only natural that COGS growth will follow revenue growth. The only thing I'd want to see when it comes to this is revenue growth outpacing COGS growth which it has in Lockheed's case.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we see a 2020 total of $6.833 Billion, a 9.63% gain YoY and a 112.04% gain from 5 years ago (I left out 3-year growth because they had just spun-off a company meaning we get a growth rate of 248.46%).

**Margins**

Lockheed Martin currently has a net margin of 10.45%. Their net margin has expanded by 17.54% in the last 5 years. Comparing this margin to their peers, Raytheon is currently operating at a -5.55% net margin and General Dynamics is operating at an 8.35% margin.

**Cash On Hand/Debt**

Lockheed Martin currently has cash on hand of 3.16 Billion, representing an increase of over 108% YoY. The amount of cash they've stockpiled makes me think they may be gearing up for an acquisition, or (much more likely) continuing to pay done debt.

Speaking of debt, Lockheed Martin has been paying down debt significantly for the last 5 years. They've shrunken debt by 18.42% in the last 5 years and 13.64% in the last 3 years.

**Free Cash Flow**

Lockheed Martin has had a growing FCF for a while now. In the last 3 years, they've grown FCF by 41.22%, and grown it by 92.88% from 5 years ago.

**Dividends**

One of the most surprising things I found about Lockheed is its dividends. Lockheed currently pays a 2.99% annual dividend ($2.60 quarterly) that they've grown for 18 consecutive years. In the last 5 years, they've grown the dividend by 59.34% and maintain a payout ratio of 40.75%.

For me, the fact that they pay such a hefty and sustainable quarterly dividend was just an affirmation that Lockheed has been undervalued by the market.

**Price Ratios/Other**

Lockheed has a TTM PE of 13.24x. This compares well with the current average industrials PE of \~32x. Considering the growth rates we've observed in the last 3-5 years, I feel like this is a pretty low PE, although I recognize the short-comings and general unreliability of the PE ratio when it comes to valuation.

What I find really interesting about Lockheed is just how efficient they are at generating capital. They have an ROE of **149.38%!** This number is even more insane when you consider their peers' ROEs. Raytheon has an ROE of -5.53%, General Dynamics has an ROE of 23.00% and Northrop Grumman has an ROE of 32.03%.

**Conclusion**

I'm really bullish on Lockheed. I think they've been undervalued by the market just because they're a member of a sector with some laggards. That being said, I would love to hear some second opinions as I'm not as experienced as many of you are.","self","https://redd.it/lefmsf"

**SQBG - Sequential Brands Group**

Current Market Cap: 27M

Share Price: 16.31

\*\*\*Note: this is a very leveraged company in an out of favor industry\*\*\*

**Introduction**

Sequential Brands Group is a brand management company that licenses several apparel and shoe brands to wholesalers and some d2c sellers. These brands are mostly sold at major big box brick and mortar retailers and Amazon. Some brands include: Jessica Simpson, AND1, AVIA, Ellen Tracy and GAIAM. Large shareholders include Chairman William Sweedler and Martha Stewart. The company is heavily leveraged (450M) and has seen its share price suffer over the last several years. 

**Why spend time on this equity stub?**

Near term catalyst. The company has aggressively reduced costs and has packaged itself for sale.

**Recent history**

In mid 2019 SQBG sold its home division, which included the Martha Stewart Living and Emiril Legassi brands. It later announced a focus on cost reductions. This consisted primarily of examining lease expenses and headcount reduction. Prior to the sale of the home division, operating expenses were \~70M and the stated long term goal was 30M. In later 2019, an announcement stating exploration of strategic alternatives was made. This was in response to receiving unsolicited interest in some of their brands. Ultimately, no sale transpired and the share price expectedly suffered greatly.

2020 was very difficult for anyone relying on brick and mortar sales. A few highlights from SQBG: 

3/20 - Company started working with a lender (Wilmington Trust) due to inability to comply with certain covenants. These were waived until the end of the year. 

3/20 - Took asset impairment charge on brand value   
11/20 - CEO and CFO left the company. Chairman William Sweedler (13% shareholder) is filling a “Principle Executive Officer” role and an interim CFO has joined. She has experience in M&A and is hired temporarily.  CEO position will not be filled.

11/20 - Bought out the lease for their expensive NYC corporate main office. This was the vast majority of their lease obligations.

12/20 - Issued press release stating relaunch of strategic alternative search in order to “Fully maximize shareholder value”.

12/20 - Lender waived covenants  until Feb 22, 2021.

**This is not a fire sale**

Management has successfully cut expenses and the company is now cash flow positive. The expense reduction initiatives have been successful and we are near the previous 30M run rate goal. The vast majority of lease obligations have been eliminated.

Reported shareholders equity is 27M. This follows the 2020 impairment charge taken during the early phase of Covid-19 store closures. Note, there is no mechanism to increase this equity in case value returns or increases. This therefore represents what management thought the brands were worth at the time of impaired sales and earnings. Shareholders equity is coincidentally equal to today’s market cap. Additionally, the company has 300M in NOL’s and shouldn’t pay taxes for sometime. 

**A quick look at the valuation**

Mkt Cap 27M

Cash 13M

Debt \~ 450M 

EV \~ 464M

q3 EBIT 16.4M; annualized = **65M** (q4 likely stronger)

EV/EBIT = 7.1x

The home business (Martha Stewart Living and Emeril Legassi) sold for EBIT multiple of 8x (excluding a 40M earn out). 

8x multiple  =  **70M equity value** 

*(8x 65) -450 =70*

Competitor(s).

This is an out of favor industry. Major competitors include APEX (delisted, solvency questions) and Iconix. Iconix is most similar. After a recent run-up in share price, Iconix trades at EV/EBIT = 10.5x. 

10.5x multiple = **232.5M mkt cap** 

**Connecting the dots**

Sequential Brands is now a company with no CEO, no CFO, and no corporate HQ.  Expenses have been aggressively cut. What we are left with is a nice lean package ready for sale. Their lender is providing extensions and therefore presumably believes a sale is at least possible. Furthermore, they likely do not want to be handed the keys to this brand management company. Management (Chairman owns 13%) is highly incentivized to get a deal done before 4/2021, as after that date the lender takes the board seats.

**Discussion**

During the worst in-person retail environment of last year, the company took an impairment charge related to brand valuation. Net debt, this corresponds to today's market cap. We can use this value (27M) as a bottom valuation, as sales have since recovered. In 2019, Sequential sold its home division at an 8x EBIT multiple. If we apply this multiple, we see a market cap of 56M. We should note that the current brand composition achieves a higher margin (>65%) than the home division(\~50%). If we use the most similar competitor’s multiple (ICON), we see a much higher valuation. To summarize, it's not clear what a sale will produce. However, we have a very motivated management team on a short timeline and a company tee’d up for a sale. If a sale happens, we have downside protection with upside optionality depending on the sale multiple. 

RISK: If a sale fails to materialize, the company will be in the hands of a creditor and valuation will likely suffer greatly.

**Business Description**

CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership that makes and sells nitrogen fertilizers in the United States. They are the only pure play publicly listed North American nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer. They operate two facilities located in Coffeyville, Kansas, and East Dubuque, Illinois. CVR Partners’ primary product is UAN, a value-added nitrogen-based fertilizer. The proximity of the manufacturing facilities to end markets gives them a $15-$25/t freight advantage vs. imports ([UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html)).

**Opportunity**

Production of UAN is a high fixed cost business. The operating leverage allows for outsized profits in a favorable commodity market. The price of nitrogen fertilizers tends to slightly lag crop prices - primarily corn and beans. When the price of corn is high, the incremental yield from fertilizing generates more revenue than the cost of the fertilizer. This incentivizes farmers to use more fertilizer. In December 2020, the price of corn rose to a 7-year high and is ~$5.50 per bushel. [Corn futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html) are forecast to stay above $5.00 per bushel through the summer. [Q1 UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola-swaps.html) prices followed in January 2021 rising from $150/t to ~$240/t. CVR Partners’ breakeven UAN gate price (the point at which there are zero annual distributions to unitholders) is $169/t UAN. Note that this implies a UAN NOLA (Futures Price) of $144-154/t when you factor in their freight advantage. This analysis does not include an in-depth forecast of commodity markets. For simplicity, I’ve assumed current commodity future prices remain constant. Use the sensitivity table at the end for returns at your own assumed UAN price. 

**Forecast**

Q4/20 will be terrible. Using the [UAN River Points spread](https://my.stonex.com/s/subcategory?language=en_US&commodityId=9056), CVR Partners gate price was about $150/t UAN. This isn't enough for a distribution. I estimate that there will be a cash burn of $10-$15MM for the quarter. Not good, but Q4/20 is in the rearview mirror now. What makes CVR Partners compelling is when we look at how the market has evolved for 2021. My 2021 forecast assumes pricing that is consistent with current [CME Globex futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html). The average UAN NOLA is $213/t for H1 and $171/t for H2. Assuming this pricing for end products, UAN will generate $5.37 per unit in distributions in H1. Were it not for the scheduled turnaround (plant maintenance) at Coffeyville in Q3, there would be another $1.87 in H2. However, a conservative 28-day turnaround leaves us with an additional $0.42 distribution in H2. If CVR Partners meets their operating targets, current commodity prices support 2021 distributions of $5.79 per unit after all maintenance, turnarounds, and service of the current debt is accounted for.

**9.25% Callable Notes**

CVR Partners has $645M principle 9.25% coupon senior secured notes due in 2023. The notes were issued to fund the acquisition of the East Dubuque plant. These notes are callable in June 2021 without a penalty. The current market yield for single B issuers is ~5%. If CVR Partners are able to refinance the 9.25% senior secured notes with a high yield issue at 5%, this will save them $27M per year in interest and generate an additional $2.47 in distributions per unit. On previous conference calls, management have indicated their intention to refinance these notes in June 2021. With a simple dividend discount model and a 10% cost of equity capital, the incremental CAFD from refinancing the debt is worth more than the current share price. I believe this forms a value floor for the current units and mitigates the inherent commodity price risk.

**Risks**

CVR Partners operate in a commodity driven business. Results will be heavily impacted by the prices realized for end products (UAN, Urea, Ammonia) and, to a lesser extent, input costs (natural gas, pet coke). Demand for fertilizer in the spring will be impacted by corn and bean prices, acres planted, and weather conditions. Volumes of imports will also impact UAN prices in CVR Partners’ local markets. CVR Partners’ may also suffer from operational issues at its plants.

**Conclusion**

In the 3 years prior to the pandemic, CVR Partners traded in a range of $25 - $42 per unit with UAN prices sub-$200. On the back of rising crop prices, 2021 fertilizer forecasts are looking strong going into the spring planting season. CVR Partners offers pure play exposure to North American nitrogen fertilizer and is positioned well to benefit from current prices. Refinancing the senior secured notes provides significant additional unit value that can be crystalized independent of future commodity prices. At the current unit price, the risk vs. reward is very favorable.

**This Howard Marks quote below about ""sticking to your discipline"" inspired me to dig into the data a bit to see how much truth there is to it.** My comments below. Interested in any feedback!

""There are a lot of ways to make money. Growth investors, value investors, momentum investors, traders. You and I think fundamental investing and buying things for less than they're worth is the most dependable of those... Techniques go in and out of style. And sometimes if they work too well for too long then they stop working merely because they worked too well for too long; their end is self-created. Barton Biggs published a book in the first decade of this century called Hedge Hogging. And he had a section where he talked about the most famous investors, and how much time they spent in the dog house. We all have to accept that no approach works all the time. And certainly no approach is the best all the time. It rotates. And we should come to a conclusion about which way is the best and we should hold to it strongly - and accept the fact that it will be out of style from time to time. Accepting a philosophy and sticking to it is much better than having no philosophy and dabbling with each one when you guess it's going to work. I always say if you stand at a bus stop long enough you'll get a bus. But if you run from bus stop to bus stop you may never get a bus. And I think that's an important thing for people to accept, nothing will work all the time.""

Of course there's truth to this and intuitively it makes sense. This got me curious though. **What does the data look like for some kind of measured trend-following strategy?** Say, for example, we compared these four approaches.

A. An S&P index fund 1994-2021

B. A US value index fund that whole time

C. A US growth index fund that whole time

D. An approach that shifts to value or growth, based on what outperformed in the previous year.

I'm curious enough to investigate this question so I'll follow up with results. I'm going to guess that C did best, followed by D, followed by A, followed by B, though I'm keen to see what the data says.

Grains of salt:

1. Keep in mind that trend-following benefited from extended periods of outperformance by one style or the other during this period (growth outperformed 1994-1999, 2009-2012, & 2017-2020; value outperformed 2000-2006). Who's to say there won't be more alternation year-to-year in the future?
2. What Marks considers ""sticking to a discipline"" is not the same thing as sticking to a factor, though I think factors are an ok proxy for a thought experiment. The crux of his point is that investors are better off sticking with a good discipline then following every trend they hear about, which is surely true.

These caveats aside, here's what I found.

**UPDATE #1:**

Wow! Interesting results. Here's how these 4 portfolios compare, dating back to January 1994 (when some of these Vanguard funds first came out).

Compound Annual Growth Rate = ((final $/beginning $) \^ (1/# of years)) - 1

1994-2021:

1. Vanguard Growth VIGRX 11.2%
2. **Trend-Following Portfolio (either value or growth) 10.91%**
3. Vanguard S&P 500 VFINX 9.98%
4. Vanguard Value VIVAX 8.94%

FYI, I created the ""trend-following"" portfolio using the dynamic allocation tool from the website portfolio visualizer. For each year, the ""trend-following"" portfolio is either set to growth (VIGRX) or value (VIVAX) - based on whichever factor performed better the year prior. The trend-following portfolio is: 1994 Value, 1995-2000 Growth, 2001-2007 Value, 2008 Growth, 2009 Value, 2010-2013 Growth, 2014 Value, 2015-2016 Growth, 2017 Value, 2018-2021 Growth.

Here's a chart of the trend-following portfolio (""Dynamic Allocation"") vs the S&P 500 (""Static Allocation"") from 1994 thru today. https://pasteboard \[dot\] co/JOfTYbr.png

**What's the takeaway here?**

**The point of this backtest is not to advocate any particular trend-following approach (though it actually doesn't look like a bad strategy!). It's to challenge the notion that investors need to stay rigidly consistent in a discipline to outperform.** If they have reason to evolve their approach with the times, perhaps they should.

All the best investors investors have experienced periods of underperformance. For those who want to give themselves a chance to perform among the best quartile/quintile of investors, sticking with a single style may be your best bet! There's a reason the growth portfolio outperformed the trend-following portfolio a bit; missing out on a rotation by definition ensures you won't have the best returns possible. Just keep in mind, (at least from a factor perspective) if you stuck to your principles and guessed wrong during this period, you would've ranked last. **If your goal is to give yourself the best chance possible to outperform the market, catching the bus a year late might not be such a bad approach**.

At the very least, this suggests that it's probably not a good idea to do the opposite! Meaning, frequently shift away from the style that's in favor assuming a near-term reversion.

**UPDATE #2**

To stress test this trend-following idea a bit, I've re-run the backtest in a couple ways.

**1st challenge: Begin the backtest in the worst possible year (2000)**

First, let's start the backtest in the worst possible starting year. Let's set the first year to 2000, with the trend portfolio starting out fully in growth just in time to get slammed by the tech bubble. This made it a lot closer, but the rank order of the portfolios actually stayed the same.

2000-2021:

1. Vanguard Growth VIGRX 6.85% CAGR
2. **Trend-Following Portfolio (either value or growth) 6.66%**
3. Vanguard S&P 500 VFINX 6.42%
4. Vanguard Value VIVAX 6.35%

The trend following portfolio remains above-index.

Here's a chart for this timeframe. https://pasteboard \[dot\] co/JOffvDJ.png

**2nd challenge: Assume a tech-bubble event in 2021**

To challenge this idea in another way, let's assume there's a tech-bubble level crash in 2021. This essentially represents the worst-case scenario for the trend-following portfolio, since it would be fully invested in growth in 2021.

In 2000, the S&P lost 9.06%, growth (VIGRX) lost 22.21%, and value actually **gained** 6.08%.

Let's say the same thing happens in 2021 and re-calculate CAGR.

If there's a tech bubble type year in 2021, here's how the 4 strategies compare from 1994 through the 2021 tech bubble.

1994 - 2021 (assuming a tech bubble level collapse this year):

1. Vanguard Growth VIGRX 10.45% (down from 11.2%)
2. **Value/Growth Annual Trend-Following 10.16% (down from 10.91%)**
3. Vanguard S&P 500 VFINX 9.83% (down from 9.98%)
4. Vanguard Value VIVAX 9.39% (up from 8.94%)

**Whether you assume catastrophe for the first or last year, a trend-following approach would have outperformed the market over the last few market cycles. If you want to shoot for the top spot on the leader-board, sticking it out on one side of the spectrum or the other might be the way to go, but it's also the way to bottom spot, too.**

As a value investor who's come around to holding major positions in GARP stocks like AMZN, MSFT, FB, & GOOGL in recent years, this is encouraging to me.

""We shall conclude with a practical observation that is based on experience rather than theory. When the general market is high  there are always a number of individual issues that appear definitely undervalued by objective standards and consequently even more attractive in contrast to the inflated level of other  stocks. The analyst may be tempted to recommend these as unusual opportunities. Not only may the “neglected security” continue neglected for the remainder of the bull market, but when the downturn comes it is likely to decline in price along with the general market and to fully as great an extent. In a word, beware of “bargains” when most stocks seem very high.""

* He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019 (pre-covid)
* As of early 2021 all 100 companies have posted a 100% return
   * (Share price at end of 2019 - Share price End of January 2021) / (Share price at end of 2019)

I thought that statement was bonkers, so I took a list of NYSE + NASDAQ companies \~ 6500, excluded SPACs/warrants and anything that through an error in google sheets (lazy I know), which left around 5000 equities.

* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 3,130 have posted a >100% return from their 52 week low
* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 500 have posted a >500% return from their 52 week low

So I try to rationalize these as buying opportunities as a result from COVID but when I filter the 5,000 equities to only include companies w/ a TTM EPS of <0 **I am left with 2500.**

So 2500, or \~50% of the total universe of equities on NYSE + NASDAQ, over a 12 month window, have not been profitable (as defined by TTM EPS <0).

What blows my mind is of these 2,500 ""unprofitable companies"" :

1,795 have had a >100% return from their 52 week low500 of the have had a >50% return YTD

WTF?

* 50% of all publicly traded NASDAQ/NYSE companies are not profitable
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Result = 2500
* Yet 35% have posted a 100% return from their 52 week low
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Filter 2 = Filter 1 + only list equities where ((current price - 52weeklow)/52weeklow) > 100% )
   * Result = 1795
* And 10% have had a **2021 YEAR TO DATE RETURN OF > 50%**
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS <0
   * Filter 2 = Filter 1 + only list equities where ( (currentprice - price on 1/1/21) / price on 1/1/21 ) > 50%)
   * Result = 500

I mean guys, do this yourself if you don't believe me - it's literally 5 GOOGLEFINANCE functions a bunch of pivot tables in excel.

What I dont have is a relative basis for comparison, e.g if these numbers are normal in a pre-covid environment, e.g. 5 years ago, 10 years ago, etc.

I mean I love a good rally, and i'm definitely in some risky small caps but when I see companies like SOUTHWEST AIRLINES posting negative quarter-over-quarter earnings, yet it is trading back at pre-pandemic levels I have come to one of two conclusions:

1. **My math is wrong and I am in a moron**
2. There will be a ""major correction"" in 2021

I would love to get feedback from the community at large, especially from the contrarians and old timers. Also, if one were to ""capitalize on a major correction in the next 12 months"" what would you recommend? Buy VIX?","self","https://redd.it/lk6c44"

The Company is the largest independent supplier of OLED DDICs which power the display screens, and focused on high frame rate phones. It’s tied to the hip of Samsung and LG and a big winner in the OLED space especially with 5G and will most likely beat their Q4 guidance. OLED and chip manufacturers are fully sold out as per guidance from several semiconductor companies.

For each phone with OLED, there is 1 DDIC. For a rollable or foldable OLED screen, there are more than 1 DDIC chip on average. The Company is also getting into laptop, TV, and auto OLED screens which all use more than 1 chip (given larger size).

**Q4 2020 Guidance Beat**

Q4 '20 revenue/profits are likely to surprise, here’s why: in their most recent analyst presentation, they said their Q4 guidance put out in Q3 was based on LOWER manufacturing capacity from their foundry partners. That allocation went up.

From the analyst call: ""Our Q4 revenue guidance range was based on allocation from foundry partners for OLED as well as internal Fab 3 ramp-up. We were able to secure greater supply than we originally expected.""

&#x200B;

[MX Guidance on Additional Foundry Allocation](https://preview.redd.it/flb34pst9uh61.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=70ade06f843071dd22ec8fb9f8039c8573ae2c4f)

The supply crunch is affecting 8"" fabs and the Company focuses on using 12"" foundries which are less tight, and that explains why Magna Chip was able to receive more allocation.

In addition, there is likely strong forward guidance given improved margins below...

**Supply Crunch and Potential Acquirer?**

Synaptics, a $3.7bln market cap company that dominates the adjacent semiconductor touch chips for OLED screens (called TDDI, used in all AAPL phones) in their earnings call on Feb 4 said there is a supply crunch in OLED DDICs and a potential for ""a tactical opportunity"":

""Given the supply crunch, we've seen an opening, an opportunity for us for OLED DDICs...The current supply base in OLED DDICs has been compressed..\\\[On\\\]...the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity.""

&#x200B;

Synaptics acquired an OLED DDIC company in the past (8-9 years ago) and did not make much out of it, focusing on the touch aspect versus the IC chip. However, margins for OLED DDICs are improving based on their comments and bodes well for the Company.

HIMX, another company operating in the display panel space (albeit not in OLED), has said that the transition from LCD to OLED screens is happening fast and sees OLED DDIC s as a major opportunity: ""As we have repeatedly indicated, traditional smartphone DDICs are quickly being replaced by TDDI and AMOLED....We believe AMOLED driver IC will soon become one of the major growth drivers for our small- and medium-panel driver IC business in 2021.""

&#x200B;

[HIMX Earnings Call Feb 2021](https://preview.redd.it/zhyh84d0auh61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ff6863f36bca877e2c153b3143f20fc3bdf473)

In fact, HIMX said that given the ""helplessly tight"" semiconductor situation. **""We can very often transfer the cost increase to customers and a bit more.""**

**This is YJ Kim's (MX CEO) comments from Q3 earnings that supports many design wins with next generation 5G smartphones:**

5G momentum: We are enjoying the booming 5G smartphone industry especially with High Frame Rate (HFR) OLED DDIC. In Q3, we were awarded 8 new design wins, and 7 of them were 5G and HFR models using 28 nm process. You may recall that our revenue from 5G smartphones counted for about 20% of the total OLED revenue in 1H 2020. In Q3, 5G revenue represented about 40% of the OLED revenue. According to the market data, the global 5G smartphone shipment in 2020 will be about 200 million units, and it will likely to be more than double in 2021.

**Conclusion**

For a global leader in a key component of OLED displays and with 5G phones / increase in display resolution and frame rates (for video games) and management said in their analyst calls (all online in IR videos) they are sold out in July (and likely Sep) from demand -> drastically undervalued at \\\~7xEV/EBITDA valuation...

Recommendation: Shares are more attractive given the options are somewhat thinly traded.

**Some news articles** (from another [u/wallstreetbets1999](https://www.reddit.com/u/wallstreetbets1999/)

Magnachip has a good chance to get into the iPhone13, as Samsung is the sole supplier of OLED LPTO panels to the iPhone13 (noted below), and Magnachip has one of the best OLED DDIC drivers, the 28nm chip that supports HFR, 120hz and LPTO as noted below.

Some background on Magnachip Semiconductor as they are the leading independent supplier of OLED DDIC and they tapped out the industry leading chip, the 28nm OLED DDIC back in 2019 for the current transition of 5G smartphones that are adapting OLED panels, as noted in a recent press release.

Raj Gill from Needham noted back then this chip could make it into the next generation of iPhones.

May 1, 2018 – Magnachip upgraded by Needham and company citing

“Importantly, while still unknown, we believe MX is in a good competitive position to be a second source to Apple for the OLED DDIC next year as it is taping out a 28nm OLED DDIC with exceptional low-power."" Link below.

Listen to the Needham Growth Conference with Magnachip CEO

They recently participated in the 23rd annual needham growth conference on January 12th. A lot of this analysis is based on this call. Link below to the recorded call with Raj Gill from Needham and YJ the CEO of Magnachip. Start listening from 15:30 as Raj Gill asks questions.

Registration is easy….just put in your info no account is created, it takes you straight to the presentation from YJ Kim of Magnachip.

Listen to the whole thing of you like…Q&A starts at 15:30 which supports my thoughts on a Q4 beat and possibly an iPhone13 OLED DDIC driver design win later as noted below.

At 20:20 in the interview Magnachip’s CEO YJ Kim states and I am paraphrasing “Q4 guidance was based on numbers given from my foundry partners, Global Foundries and another foundry partner. We were able to get more supply from both of our foundry partners as a result of our C-level and my direct customer putting weight on the foundry partners”

At 21:35 Raj Gill and YJ Kim discuss that Magnachip is working with a 3rd foundry partner to expand capacity for OLED DDIC drivers. In my option this will raise the target numbers for fiscal year 2021 for their OLED DDIC business and I suspect this 3rd foundry partner is TSMC as noted by DigiTimes below.

TSMC in talks for new orders for OLED driver IC (subscription required to read the whole article)

Monica Chen, Hsinchu; Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES

Wednesday 18 November 2020

TSMC is in talks with a Korean client for manufacturing OLED driver ICs using the foundry's 28nm high-voltage process, according to industry sources.

The new orders would further tighten TSMC's 28nm process capacity, which has seen strong demand despite its higher quotes than those offered by other foundry houses, the sources indicated.

At 35:40 in the conference Raj Gill from Needham references an article that Samsung will be the exclusive supplier for LPTO OLED panels to iPhone13. and he asks JY KIM – what does that mean for your business? YJ Kim responds and I am paraphrasing “We support LPTO display requirements with our display chip already. In addition we have a strong relationship with the top OLED panel makers” Raj Gill is most likely referring to this article in the Korean Press from 01/06/2021– TheElec.com - Samsung to be the exclusive supplier of LTPO OLED for next iPhone 13

Magnachip could very well have the 28NM - OLED DDIC chip design win with Samsung panels / LPTO with Magnachip's OLED DDIC.

This is YJ Kim Magnachip CEOs comments from Q3 earnings that supports many design wins with next generation 5G smartphones:

Paper from late January 2021 quantifying the impact of Robinhood traders on the market. Interesting to see some numbers on this. I've pasted the Abstract & Conclusion below; see the link above for the full paper. Comment with any thoughts.

## Abstract

Retail trading activity has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper quantifies the impact of the retail investment boom on the US stock market within a structural model. Using account holdings data from the online trading platform “Robinhood Markets Inc.” and 13F filings, we estimate retail and institutional demand curves and derive aggregate pricing implications via market clearing. The inelastic nature of institutional demand allows Robinhood investors to have a substantial effect on stock returns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their negligible market share of 0.2%, we find that Robinhood traders account for over 7% of the cross-sectional variation in stock returns during the second quarter of 2020. We furthermore show that without the surge in retail trading activity the aggregate market capitalization of the smallest quintile of US stocks would have been over 30% lower. Lastly, Robinhood traders are able to affect the price of some large individual companies that are being held primarily by passive institutional investors.

## Conclusion

This paper investigates the effects of retail trading activity on the US equity market within a structural model. To quantify the respective impact of retail and institutional demand on the US equity market, we use the Demand System Approach to Asset Pricing introduced by Koijen and Yogo (2019). We find that the majority of all institutional investors - who hold over 60% of the market - have inelastic demand. Because they respond inelastically to price changes, the small retail sector can have substantial price effects. We show, that over 7% of the cross-sectional variation in stock returns during the pandemic can be attributed to the demand of Robinhood traders. They furthermore alleviated the stock market crash during the first quarter of 2020 by 2%. By buying the small cap stocks that institutions were fire-selling they provided considerable liquidity to the US stock market. Robinhood traders also boosted the recovery in Q2 by adding 1% to the aggregate stock market valuation. Given our approximation of their assets under management, this implies a multiplier effect of 5. The price impact of Robinhood traders is concentrated towards small cap stocks and the consumer staples industry. However, they are able to affect the price of some large companies, which are being held primarily by passive investors. Our analysis shed light on the intricate relationship between retail and institutional investors. The Demand System offers a feedback mechanism in which one agent’s demand shock reverberates on another’s demand function through market equity. We show that when institutions react sluggishly to non-fundamental price changes, the mechanism stifles and retail demand shocks can have substantial impacts on stock prices. Our findings have important implications for policy makers. Large scale policies, such as the 2020 CARES act, have the potential to move prices considerably far from their fundamental values, if households invest rather than consume their share. Moreover, the prominent role of Robinhood traders in driving returns evokes concerns about the future role of retail trading in equity markets. If - facilitated by novel fintech solutions - the retail sector continues to grow its wealth share, the extraordinary volatility observed during the pandemic may turn out to be the new normal.","self","https://redd.it/lm657c"

The current share price is at the high end of my most optimistic estimate of its fair value. By my estimate, the current price assumes very strong growth, compounding, for the next 5-10 years. I've seriously considered selling some of this position over the last week because it is by far my largest position, but I've held myself back because I like the company and plan to hold it for a long time.

At the same time this company has been continuously diluting their shares over the last 5 years and this has always been my biggest concern as I don't like to see my ownership diluted. However, at the current valuations I am now starting to realize that if the company starts to issue more shares, it will benefit me and I should continue to hold. They already have a shelf registration in place, so I imagine they are already selling more shares.

I've pretty much always operated under the assumption that any share dilution will be bad for owners, but now I'm realizing that isn't always the case and that extremely high valuations can be very beneficial to current owners and are not always a reason to sell. Some approximate numbers for this case:

 - Current market cap = $1,200
 - Estimated forward net income per year = $62

Let's assume over the next 10 years the net income remains the same. In this case, my total income over the next 10 years would be $620

Now let's see what happens if we dilute the shares by 10% (note, I'm going to assume no cost or effect on share price of the dilution)

 - Market cap after dilution = $1,320
 - Cash from issuance = $120
 - Estimated forward net income per year = $74

We are assuming that the money that we raised can return 10% per year so that our new 10 year income number is $740. We are diluted by 10%, so our share of profits are now $672.72, about 8% higher than if we hadn't sold more shares. Even if the extra cash isn't put to profitable use, but management wastes half of it then returns the other half back to shareholders at the end of 10 years, our share of the profits would still be $618 at the end, almost no worse off than if management hadn't issued more shares at all.

I think in this case there can still be an argument made to sell. As the dilution occurs and the market corrects back to a more realistic valuation I am expecting the price to fall. I could sell now and buy back in at a lower price, but I think psychologically I will do better if I just hold. I imagine that there could be a case where I sell out and the stock never drops again and I never buy in again.

**Business Description**

CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership that makes and sells nitrogen fertilizers in the United States. They are the only pure play publicly listed North American nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer. They operate two facilities located in Coffeyville, Kansas, and East Dubuque, Illinois. CVR Partners’ primary product is UAN, a value-added nitrogen-based fertilizer. UAN is a seasonal product with the primary application taking place in the spring planting season. The proximity of the manufacturing facilities to end markets gives them a $15-$25/t freight advantage vs. imports ([UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html)).

**Opportunity**

Production of UAN is a high fixed cost business. The operating leverage allows for outsized profits in a favorable commodity market. The price of nitrogen fertilizers tends to slightly lag crop prices - primarily corn and beans. When the price of corn is high, the incremental yield from fertilizing generates more revenue than the cost of the fertilizer. This incentivizes farmers to use more fertilizer. In December 2020, the [price of corn](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/corn-price) rose to a 7-year high and is ~$5.50 per bushel. [Corn futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html) are forecast to stay above $5.00 per bushel through the summer. [Q1 UAN NOLA](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola-swaps.html) prices followed in January 2021 rising from $150/t to ~$240/t. CVR Partners’ breakeven UAN gate price (the point at which there are zero annual distributions to unitholders) is $169/t UAN. Note that this implies a UAN NOLA (Futures Price) of $144-154/t when you factor in their freight advantage. This analysis does not include an in-depth forecast of commodity markets. For simplicity, it’s assumed current commodity future prices remain constant. Use the sensitivity table at the end for returns at your own assumed UAN price. 

**Forecast**

Q4/20 was terrible. CVR Partners gate price was about $139/t UAN. The partnership lost $10MM in OCF. Not good, but Q4/20 is in the rearview mirror now. What makes CVR Partners compelling is when we look at how the market has evolved for 2021. The 2021 forecast assumes pricing that is consistent with current [CME Globex futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/fertilizer/uan-fob-nola_quotes_globex.html). The average UAN NOLA is $236/t for H1 and $187/t for H2. Assuming this pricing for end products, UAN will generate $109MM in EBITDA in H1. Were it not for the scheduled turnaround (plant maintenance) at Coffeyville in Q3, there would be another $60MM EBITDA in H2. However, a conservative 28-day turnaround leaves us with an additional $48MM EBITDA in H2. If CVR Partners meets their operating targets, current commodity prices support 2021 EBITDA of $157MM. Using a historical multiple of 8.0x EV / EBITDA implies a share price of ~$60.00 per share.

This valuation approach is more conservative than the CAFD I used previously. The valuation used previously (10x CAFD) implies a 9x EV/EBITDA multiple. I’ve moved away from the CAFD because I expect that there will be a lot of noise in the 2021 CAFD which skews the underlying performance. The noise will be driven by: 1 – buybacks have reduced CAFD ($10M in 2020 and another $10M expected in Q1/21). 2 – Reserves for debt refinance fees and potential reduction in principle outstanding. 3 – Transaction/structuring fees to monetize the tax credits. See below for more details on these. I’ve provided calculation summaries and sensitivities on each driver so that you can easily use your own assumptions and come up with your own view on value. 

**A Gift From The Government**

In January 2021, the US government approved [Section 45Q](https://www.projectfinance.law/publications/tax-credits-for-carbon-capture). Section 45Q provides tax credits for carbon capture. CVR Partners sequesters about 1 million metric tons of carbon per year. They indicated on their Q4/20 call and in the [2020 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425292/000142529221000007/cvi-20201231.htm) that they are exploring options to monetize these tax credits. The form of this structure is still unknown, but it seems they will try to time this with the refinancing of their debt in June 2021. If they can monetize these credits, the estimated value of the credits from 2021-25 (the period the current regs cover) is $103MM @ 10% discount rate. If they can claim credits for previous sequestration from 2018-2020, this is an additional $53MM. The total value of these on a per share basis is between $9 and $14 per share.

**9.25% Callable Notes**

CVR Partners has $645M principle 9.25% coupon senior secured notes due in 2023. The notes were issued to fund the acquisition of the East Dubuque plant. These notes are callable in June 2021 without a penalty. The current market yield for single B issuers is ~5%. If CVR Partners can refinance the 9.25% senior secured notes with a high yield issue at 5%, this will save them $27M per year in interest. On previous conference calls, management have indicated their intention to refinance these notes in June 2021. With a simple dividend discount model and a 10% cost of equity capital, the incremental value from refinancing the debt is worth the current share price. This forms a compelling value floor for the shares.

**Risks**

CVR Partners operate in a commodity driven business. Results will be heavily impacted by the prices realized for end products (UAN, Urea, Ammonia) and, to a lesser extent, input costs (natural gas, pet coke). Demand for fertilizer in the spring will be impacted by corn and bean prices, acres planted, and weather conditions. Volumes of imports will also impact UAN prices in CVR Partners’ local markets. CVR Partners’ may also suffer from operational issues at its plants.

**Conclusion**

In the 3 years prior to the pandemic, CVR Partners traded in a range of $25 - $42 per unit with UAN prices sub-$200t/t. On the back of rising crop prices, 2021 fertilizer forecasts are looking strong going into the spring planting season. CVR Partners offers pure play exposure to North American nitrogen fertilizer and is positioned well to benefit from current prices. Regardless of the commodity forecast, there are several uncorrelated catalysts that generate substantial value independent of fertilizer prices. They are summarized below:




Value Driver| Equity Value $USMM| $ per share
---|---|----
Operations Under Current Commodity Prices| $642| $61.16
Monetize 2021-25 Carbon Credits	|	 $103  	| $9.81  
Monetize 2018-20 Carbon Credits	|	 $53  	| $5.08  
NPV of Savings From Debt Refinance |	 $274  |	 $26.13  
Total Potential Equity Value	|	 $1,072  	| $102.17  


**Potential Strategies**

**Common Units**

An investment at the equity at the current share price could result in up to 4x return on investment using the base assumptions. If macro trends persist - these trends tend to be multi-year on capital intensive, cyclical industries - this has great short and mid (1-3 year) potential with limited downside if you believe that just the Debt Refinance is possible. 

**Options**

Management has indicated that they intend to refinance the debt as soon as the bonds are callable at par (June 2021). They also plan to monetize the carbon capture credits at the same time and potentially use the proceeds to reduce debt. This creates a unique situation where all 3 major catalysts will be known by the time Q2 results are released in the 1st or 2nd week of August 2021. Purchasing options with Aug 20, 2021 expiry is an efficient way to gain leverage on these defined catalysts. You can use the sensitivities provided and the Value Driver table to come up a value using your own assumptions. Even if only part of the value is realized here, there is potential for massive gains.

Not much to pull apart here, but I will, because I love a good TPG faceplant. So, the valuation which is, apparently more than DISH? All of dish. Including Sling and 5G assets. I’ve been thinking dish is undervalued, myself. But maybe I have more faith in Charlie’s 5G than everyone else.

So my first thought is that TPG is TPG-ing again. I can’t possibly imagine how they came up with that number. AT&T also gets 4.25 billion of Jr preferred units with a 6.5% PIK. Not a PIK toggle. TPG’s contribution is 1.8bil which has them levered less than 5:1 by my back of the napkin math. Is this a good business? Because that’s what you would commit to a good business, not a dying one. Am I missing something about linear TV?

I think this is good for AT&T in terms of spectrum auction financing and just... getting rid of the business unit, albeit slowly. They need cash for the 5G auctions.

Without splitting out revenue for DTV, but given that it’s losing subscribers like they’re fleeing the Titanic, I’m going to assume it’s not doing especially well. And it really shouldn’t be, because it’s a bad service, in my subjective opinion (as someone who has cancelled it). Maybe losing just a tiny bit of money?

I’m sure the new entity will report up. But I think this is a step in the right direction for T, and I’m glad they found a buyer. Nevertheless if TPG wants your assets, you can assume your assets are crap.

I’m sure there’s more analysis to come, but as someone who has been hoping for a debt reduction at AT&T, I’m happy. And as I said I love a good TPG faceplant.","self","https://redd.it/lswbbr"

Financials is a pretty safe/obvious pick.

Something less known is that energy stocks perform pretty similarly in rising and falling interest rate environments. Over the last 50 years, energy returned 12.1% when rates were falling and 10.1% when rates were rising. Over the same time, the S&P returned 15.2% when rates were falling and 5.8% when rates were rising.

Both sectors also still look pretty undervalued.

Today I'm going to be doing a DD into Charter Communications ($CHTR). They have seen a surprisingly large appreciation for such a large-cap company, so I figured I'd do a bit of digging.

**Business**

Charter is an internet service and cable provider operating throughout 43 states. They offer services to both commercial and residential customers through Spectrum on a subscription basis. Spectrum strives at driving synergy across products by selling bundles of mobile, internet, and cable services together. This strategy has paid off as over 56% of customers subscribe to any one of these bundles.

The average residential customer spends $111.15 per month and the average commercial customer spends $165.60 per month.

Spectrum's operations can be broken up into 3 segments: Internet Services (52%), Video Services (36%), and Other Services (12%). Let's take a closer look.

**Internet Services (52% of Revenue)**

This is a fast-growing segment that's seen massive tailwinds due to COVID-19. They saw 11% growth YoY. Most of that growth occurred because of a savvy promotion they did for students. While there is a lot of competition against established giants like VZ and T, I still think they can eke out growth in their commercial and small business internet offerings.

**Video Services (36% of Revenue)**

Yikes.

It's no secret cable is a dying medium. Fubo, Hulu, Prime Video, and many others take customers from this segment and promise to continue to do so. Spectrum Cable lost 484,000 customers in 2019 and managed to maintain steady revenue from this segment through price increases which will quicken the pace of customer outflow further. If Spectrum doesn't diversify or spin this segment off, it could be nasty.

**Other (12% of Revenue)**

This segment includes the newly established mobile internet service product (88% revenue growth YoY), voice services (-6% revenue growth YoY), and advertising sales (8% revenue growth YoY). This segment could see significant growth if Spectrum plays it right. As everyone knows, competition in the mobile service industry is fierce. AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile Sprint are all players that promise to force operating margins down and competition up. The same goes for advertising services as well.

I think the thing you should take away from this segment is if Spectrum plays their hand right they can have a big success on their hands, and if they don't, this segment's going to be a huge flop.

With all the segments covered, let's move on to the fundamentals.

**Revenues**

[TTM Revenue Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/x6ldqlt7zik61.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=71050440ad6d4fdaa43f8238617ee30713662a88)

Charter has enjoyed positive revenue growth recently. YoY they've grown revenue 4.90%, over the last 3 years they've grown revenue by 15.44%, and have enjoyed revenue growth of 392.31%. In 2016, CHTR closed on their acquisition of Time Warner Cable, so the 5-year number is misleading.

Switching over the COGS (cost of goods sold), it's slightly lagged behind revenue which is good. COGS grew 4.39% YoY, 14.15% in the last 3 years, and 759.23% over the last 5 years. Again, this COGS increase is affected by the TWC acquisition.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we're shown a pretty inconsistent mess.

[Net Income Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/o9etf8dnzik61.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3932fbd7565bdae4a8a62887653bde58ac42d3)

We see a lot of spikes and downturns throughout the first 3 years followed by a consistent and large increase in the last 2 years. To quantify that, we've seen 92.14% Net Income growth YoY, 161.78% growth over the last 2 years, and -67.47% Net Income growth in the last 3 years.

**Margins**

CHTR currently has a 6.70% current Net Margin. This compares well with the 3.64% margin seen a year ago and poorly with the 23.80% margin seen 3 years ago.

**Assets/Debt**

CHTR has total assets of 144.19B, cash on hand of 1.28B, long-term debt of 77.95B, and total liabilities of 110.48B. Subtracting long-term debt from total liabilities, we see that CHTR's COH cannot cover its short-term liabilities.

[Assets Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/12e1yk8ezik61.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=235fd5de56af7dfd6118a6a79af121c6362bbbe8)

[Liabilities Growth 12\/31\/15 -\> 12\/31\/20](https://preview.redd.it/6hkxzm2hzik61.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=3793358a2e9a96d449c2597f3a80d011618c0c7c)

Looking at trends, we see that both liabilities and assets rocketed following their acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Following that initial spike, assets have slowly decreased and liabilities have slowly increased.

**Dividends**

CHTR doesn't currently pay a dividend, however, I can see it paying one in the near future for a couple of reasons. First of all, they have the Free Cash Flow to support one. In Q4 2020, CHTR brought in 1.65B in Free Cash Flow. Comparing this to Comcast which pays a 1.76% dividend and only brought in 1.52B in Free Cash Flow, I think it's not outlandish to say CHTR could easily afford to pay a 1-2% dividend.

The other reason is that they're in a defensive sector with poor growth prospects going forward. Cable is declining and the other sectors they're in are low-margin and high-competition. The only way they're going to be able to attract shareholders in these market conditions is to pay a handsome dividend.

**Price Ratios/Other**

CHTR has a current PE of 40x, which is higher than the average telecom sector PE of 29.65x. In the same vein, CHTR has a PEG of 2.1x which is decent considering the abundance of frothy valuations in today's market. CHTR has a current ROE of 9.40% implying that they're moderately efficient at generating income.

To further put that ROE number in perspective, Comcast has an ROE of 14.40%, AT&T has an ROE of 9.06%, and Dish has an ROE of 14.02%.

**DCF**

I calculated 2 scenarios. The first was assuming they continue the current year's revenue growth and grow 4.9% annually. I used a 7.5% Discount Rate for this scenario and, under those conditions, I got a fair value of $682.38 representing a >10% upside.

In the second scenario, I used far more conservative, and, in my opinion, more realistic inputs. I assumed a 2.5% revenue growth rate and a 7.5% Discount Rate. Using these new inputs, I got a fair value of $556.87 representing a downside of -10.1%

**PE Valuation**

Using a PE Value of 49.95x (the average PE over the last year), I get a fair value of $771.23 which implies a potential upside of 24.63%.

**Valuation Takeaways**

Averaging my conservative DCF price target with my more optimistic PE valuation, I get a probable fair value of $664.05 which implies a potential upside of 7.30%.

**Risks**

For any business of any size, there are risks. Here are some of the biggest ones for Charter:

1. Competition - The industries Charter operates in are highly competitive. Some of the largest and most established companies in the US (such as AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast) operate in direct competition with Charter. This has and will continue to draw down margins.
2. The Decline of Cable - Charter is very exposed to Cable which is losing customers at record paces. Anyone that still wants to retain cable services with one company or another has ruled out Charter because of their price hikes aimed at short-term revenue preservation.
3. Inability to Respond to Innovation - Being as large and as archaic as Charter means that any product changes they make occur at a very slow pace. This leaves them susceptible to any innovation that may occur in one of their operating segments.
4. Large Debt - Charter has a large amount of debt that they have to pay interest rates on. This amount of debt restricts Charter's ability to deploy large amounts of capital and makes potential creditors weary of lending them more money.
5. Warren Buffett - This is probably the least important risk, but it could have a large impact on the stock price. Charter is one of the most expensive stocks Warren Buffett owns and that makes it likely he'll begin trimming his stake at some point in 2021.

**Conclusion**

Despite its size, Charter is far from a safe play. Its large debt and exposure to cable are unappealing. Couple that with no current dividend, slow rates of growth, high competition, and a low margin of safety and you get a stock to stay away from.","self","https://redd.it/lvrk7c"

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger both preach the approach of buying wonderful businesses at a price that makes sense relative to the discounted cash they will produce and I agree with that, but Buffett's best returns in his career were when he followed the approach of Benjamin Graham of buying stocks under net current asset value(NCAV) or net-net working capital(NNWC). It seems Buffett only changed his approach after realizing that it was not possible to make high returns on that method with big money. Also many other investors seem to employ a style in-between the two methods of buying businesses that are going through a rough time and in the words of Dr Michael Burry ""seem like roadkill"" and then sell them when they return to normal methods.

Well my question is: what method do you think Buffett would use? What would you use? Which one will reduce the probability of principal loss the most? Which one will produce the highest returns repeating it for the long run? Would love your thoughts.","self","https://redd.it/lxhsg3"

Quite interesting (some charts in the link)

// **What Could Possibly Go Wrong? (Real Estate Edition)**

The excitement over rising yields and reflation has brought an analytical backlash. Both Albert Edwards, the famously bond-bullish and stock-bearish investment strategist at Societe Generale SA, and Joshi of BCA Research produced notes suggesting that the low for bond yields isn't yet in. In other words the deflationary slump has yet to run its course, and the rise in yields will itself provoke a final downswing. Edwards warns that “by going all in on that bet now, investors have likely gone too big, too soon, and are very exposed to a downside shock.” He agrees that we end with inflation, thanks to the Fed’s desperation to kindle it, but not yet.

Meanwhile Joshi makes an important argument that I have heard little about. In short, he reminds us that global real estate, all bar about 10% of which is residential, is worth far more than the world’s entire supply of stocks and bonds. At some $290 trillion, it’s even worth far more than the world’s annual gross domestic product:

This is important because housing has boomed on the back of low yields just as much as stocks — in fact, probably more. As Joshi shows, real estate prices have vastly outperformed rents, which have risen roughly in line with nominal GDP. Just as stocks’ P/E multiples have been buoyed by low yields, so house prices have been supported by startlingly cheap mortgage finance: 

 The implication is that we are all leveraged to low bond yields. As Joshi’s chart below shows, the implied rental yield paid by property has moved in line with yields on long U.S. and Chinese bonds. An increase in bond yields that in turn causes a drop of 10% in the level of global house prices isn’t hard to imagine. That would be a wealth effect of almost $30 trillion, or about a third of global GDP, and a sledgehammer to the world economy: 

Thus, Joshi argues that such a decline would inflict one last deflationary downdraft. That by extension means not betting all out on inflation just yet. He suggests the crucial stress point would come when 30-year yields reach 3.75%: 

>*where is the pain point? Our answer is that if inflation fears lifted the average US and China 30-year bond yield to 3.75 percent (from 3 percent now), it would constitute the change in trend that would unleash a massive countervailing deflationary impulse from falling house prices*

If any of this seems counterintuitive, look at the bizarre state of affairs where an entire generation seems to be unable to afford to buy a house, and adults are continuing to live in the parental home for many years after leaving school. That’s a clear indicator that housing is artificially expensive. Bringing prices down would be a great way to alleviate some of the ugliness and division in society — but it’s hard to see how that can happen without an accident. //

Would love to read the mentioned research done by Albert Edwards and Joshi.","self","https://redd.it/m07z4b"

And why small hedge funds consistently beat larger ones.","Discussion",0.82,26,0,0,16,0,"Hey all, I'm putting together a list of 150 of the best micro-size hedge funds (<250 million AUM), and I'm reaching out for ideas!

**Comment below if you happen to know of any particularly brilliant small hedge funds.**

Bonus points for small hedge funds that meet any of these criteria:

* they focus on small & micro-cap stocks
* they're less than 5 years old
* or they have under $100 million AUM (below 13F requirements) but still disclose holdings on their website/in shareholder letters anyway.

As a side note, I'm perfectly able to sort hedge funds based on size & past performance, so I'm more interested in tips on small hedge funds that may not show up towards the top of lists for 1-year, 3-year, or 5-year past performance.

\*\*On Small Hedge Funds vs Large Hedge Funds:\*\*I've recently familiarized myself with the research, and **small hedge funds have pretty meaningfully outperformed larger hedge funds over time on both a style-adjusted & risk-adjusted basis**. Some studies go back to 1994 since that's the earliest there's data on defunct funds. Others go back further and account for survivor bias in some other way. In general, the gap grows during periods when small caps outperform (since small funds are more able to go after small & micro cap stocks, and tend to), and closes slightly when small caps underperform, but overall new/small hedge funds have consistently had an edge.

**This makes intuitive sense since 1) large funds are less flexible to hunt for ideas among less-liquid small & micro-cap names, and 2) performance incentives decline which tends to decrease strategy distinctiveness (active share).**

Interestingly, **hedge fund \*age\* is also negatively correlated with returns**, in addition to size. Here's one of the better recent papers on the topic. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3169312](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3169312) If you take a look at [Table XI](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack/status/1372424915614326786) from the paper, you'll see **young AND small hedge funds perform best of all**. If you look at [Figure 1](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack/status/1372427669216854017), you'll see **they're also the most consistent year-to-year**. Their sample includes all available hedge funds, including defunct funds, from 1994-2016. (From what I gather, the gap narrowed a bit, but not enough to challenge the thesis, from 2016-2018. Haven't seen any data on the last couple years.)

To quote Warren Buffett (from a 1999 interview in Businessweek):

>""If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I’d be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. **It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money.** I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that.”

Ok, but why does this matter?

Because every filing season there's plenty of attention on big name superinvestor filings, but a lot less so on smaller, newer hedge funds. **To the extent that small hedge funds have a structural advantage, a smart approach to collect consensus holdings of a sample of leading small hedge funds could add value, especially for small-cap investors.**

The reason I'm putting together this list of 150 small hedge funds now is because I'm going to be giving this a shot in the coming months. **If you'd like to follow along or see a list of top small/micro cap stocks held by small hedge funds, the best way is to sign up for the email list in the pinned post here.** [https://twitter.com/WWSubstack](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack)

I share a weekly email that tracks any new analysis on top micro cap stocks held by hedge funds from quality sources on MicroCapClub, FinTwit, Morningstar, hedge fund letters, etc. I put a lot of work into that but it's free. Crossing fingers that enough members sign up for my paid monthly/quarterly research to make it worth my time.

Outside of great small hedge funds, if you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to share below. Thanks for the ideas!","self","https://redd.it/m7t654"
